{"Parallelogram": "In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure. The congruence of opposite sides and opposite angles is a direct consequence of the Euclidean parallel postulate and neither condition can be proven without appealing to the Euclidean parallel postulate or one of its equivalent formulations.\nBy comparison, a quadrilateral with just one pair of parallel sides is a trapezoid in American English or a trapezium in British English.\nThe three-dimensional counterpart of a parallelogram is a parallelepiped.\nThe etymology (in Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb-\u03cc\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, parall\u0113l-\u00f3grammon, a shape \"of parallel lines\") reflects the definition.\n\n\n== Special cases ==\nRectangle \u2013 A parallelogram with four angles of equal size (right angles).\nRhombus \u2013 A parallelogram with four sides of equal length. Any parallelogram that is neither a rectangle nor a rhombus was traditionally called a rhomboid but this term is not used in modern mathematics.\nSquare \u2013 A parallelogram with four sides of equal length and angles of equal size (right angles).\n\n\n== Characterizations ==\nA simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral is a parallelogram if and only if any one of the following statements is true:\nTwo pairs of opposite sides are parallel (by definition).\nTwo pairs of opposite sides are equal in length.\nTwo pairs of opposite angles are equal in measure.\nThe diagonals bisect each other.\nOne pair of opposite sides is parallel and equal in length.\nAdjacent angles are supplementary.\nEach diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two congruent triangles.\nThe sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals. (This is the parallelogram law.)\nIt has rotational symmetry of order 2.\nThe sum of the distances from any interior point to the sides is independent of the location of the point. (This is an extension of Viviani's theorem.)\nThere is a point X in the plane of the quadrilateral with the property that every straight line through X divides the quadrilateral into two regions of equal area.Thus all parallelograms have all the properties listed above, and conversely, if just one of these statements is true in a simple quadrilateral, then it is a parallelogram.\n\n\n== Other properties ==\nOpposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel (by definition) and so will never intersect.\nThe area of a parallelogram is twice the area of a triangle created by one of its diagonals.\nThe area of a parallelogram is also equal to the magnitude of the vector cross product of two adjacent sides.\nAny line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area.\nAny non-degenerate affine transformation takes a parallelogram to another parallelogram.\nA parallelogram has rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180\u00b0) (or order 4 if a square). If it also has exactly two lines of reflectional symmetry then it must be a rhombus or an oblong (a non-square rectangle). If it has four lines of reflectional symmetry, it is a square.\nThe perimeter of a parallelogram is 2(a + b) where a and b are the lengths of adjacent sides.\nUnlike any other convex polygon, a parallelogram cannot be inscribed in any triangle with less than twice its area.\nThe centers of four squares all constructed either internally or externally on the sides of a parallelogram are the vertices of a square.\nIf two lines parallel to sides of a parallelogram are constructed concurrent to a diagonal, then the parallelograms formed on opposite sides of that diagonal are equal in area.\nThe diagonals of a parallelogram divide it into four triangles of equal area.\n\n\n== Area formula ==\n\nAll of the area formulas for general convex quadrilaterals apply to parallelograms. Further formulas are specific to parallelograms:\nA parallelogram with base b and height h can be divided into a trapezoid and a right triangle, and rearranged into a rectangle, as shown in the figure to the left. This means that the area of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle with the same base and height:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        b\n        h\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K=bh.}\n  \nThe base \u00d7 height area formula can also be derived using the figure to the right. The area K of the parallelogram to the right (the blue area) is the total area of the rectangle less the area of the two orange triangles. The area of the rectangle is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            rect\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        B\n        +\n        A\n        )\n        \u00d7\n        H\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{\\text{rect}}=(B+A)\\times H\\,}\n  and the area of a single triangle is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            tri\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            A\n            2\n          \n        \n        \u00d7\n        H\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{\\text{tri}}={\\frac {A}{2}}\\times H.\\,}\n  Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        \n          K\n          \n            rect\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        2\n        \u00d7\n        \n          K\n          \n            tri\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        (\n        B\n        +\n        A\n        )\n        \u00d7\n        H\n        )\n        \u2212\n        (\n        A\n        \u00d7\n        H\n        )\n        =\n        B\n        \u00d7\n        H\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K=K_{\\text{rect}}-2\\times K_{\\text{tri}}=((B+A)\\times H)-(A\\times H)=B\\times H.}\n  Another area formula, for two sides B and C and angle \u03b8, is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        B\n        \u22c5\n        C\n        \u22c5\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K=B\\cdot C\\cdot \\sin \\theta .\\,}\n  The area of a parallelogram with sides B and C (B \u2260 C) and angle \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   at the intersection of the diagonals is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              tan\n              \u2061\n              \u03b3\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              B\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            \n              C\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K={\\frac {|\\tan \\gamma |}{2}}\\cdot \\left|B^{2}-C^{2}\\right|.}\n  When the parallelogram is specified from the lengths B and C of two adjacent sides together with the length D1 of either diagonal, then the area can be found from Heron's formula.

If edges are equal, or angles are right, the symmetry of the lattice is higher. These represent the four Bravais lattices in 2 dimensions.\n\n\n== Parallelograms arising from other figures ==\n\n\n=== Automedian triangle ===\nAn automedian triangle is one whose medians are in the same proportions as its sides (though in a different order). If ABC is an automedian triangle in which vertex A stands opposite the side a,  G is the centroid (where the three medians of ABC intersect), and AL is one of the extended medians of ABC with L lying on the circumcircle of ABC, then BGCL is a parallelogram.\n\n\n=== Varignon parallelogram ===\nThe midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral are the vertices of a parallelogram, called its Varignon parallelogram. If the quadrilateral is convex or concave (that is, not self-intersecting), then the area of the Varignon parallelogram is half the area of the quadrilateral.\n\n\n=== Tangent parallelogram of an ellipse ===\nFor an ellipse, two diameters are said to be conjugate if and only if the tangent line to the ellipse at an endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the other diameter. Each pair of conjugate diameters of an ellipse has a corresponding tangent parallelogram, sometimes called a bounding parallelogram, formed by the tangent lines to the ellipse at the four endpoints of the conjugate diameters. All tangent parallelograms for a given ellipse have the same area. \"A 4 sided shape\" -Kiwi\nIt is possible to reconstruct an ellipse from any pair of conjugate diameters, or from any tangent parallelogram.\n\n\n=== Faces of a parallelepiped ===\nA parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure whose six faces are parallelograms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFundamental parallelogram (disambiguation)\nAntiparallelogram\nLevi-Civita parallelogramoid\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nParallelogram and Rhombus - Animated course (Construction, Circumference, Area)\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Parallelogram\". MathWorld.\nInteractive Parallelogram --sides, angles and slope\nArea of Parallelogram at cut-the-knot\nEquilateral Triangles On Sides of a Parallelogram at cut-the-knot\nDefinition and properties of a parallelogram with animated applet\nInteractive applet showing parallelogram area calculation interactive applet", "Angle": "In Euclidean geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.\nAngles formed by two rays lie in the plane that contains the rays. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes. These are called dihedral angles. Two intersecting curves may also define an angle, which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection. \nAngle is also used to refer to the measure of an angle or of an angle of rotation. This measure is conventionally defined as the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius, and may be signed. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\n\n== History and etymology ==\nThe word angle comes from the Latin word anguluscode: lat promoted to code: la , meaning \"corner\"; cognate words are the Greek \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (ankyl\u03bfs), meaning \"crooked, curved\", and the English word \"ankle\". Both are connected with the Proto-Indo-European root *ank-, meaning \"to bend\" or \"bow\".Euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to Proclus, an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept.\n\n\n== Identifying angles ==\nIn mathematical expressions, it is common to use Greek letters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03c6, . . . ) as variables denoting the size of some angle (to avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol \u03c0 is typically not used for this purpose). Lower case Roman letters (a, b, c, . . . ) are also used. In contexts where this is not confusing, an angle may be denoted by the upper case Roman letter denoting its vertex. See the figures in this article for examples.\nIn geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the three points that define them. For example, the angle with vertex A formed by the rays AB and AC (that is, the lines from point A to points B and C) is denoted \u2220BAC or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                B\n                A\n                C\n              \n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {\\rm {BAC}}}}\n  . Where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may sometimes be referred to by its vertex (in this case \"angle A\").\nPotentially, an angle denoted as, say, \u2220BAC, might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see \u00a7 Signed angles). However, in many geometrical situations, it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, in which case no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that \u2220BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and \u2220CAB the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.\n\n\n== Types of angles ==\n\n\n=== Individual angles ===\nThere is some common terminology for angles, whose measure is always non-negative (see \u00a7 Signed angles):\nAn angle equal to 0\u00b0 or not turned is called a zero angle.\nAn angle smaller than a right angle (less than 90\u00b0) is called an acute angle (\"acute\" meaning \"sharp\").\nAn angle equal to 1/4 turn (90\u00b0 or \u03c0/2 radians) is called a right angle. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be normal, orthogonal, or perpendicular.\nAn angle larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) is called an obtuse angle (\"obtuse\" meaning \"blunt\").\nAn angle equal to 1/2 turn (180\u00b0 or \u03c0 radians) is called a straight angle.\nAn angle larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0) is called a reflex angle.\nAn angle equal to 1 turn (360\u00b0 or 2\u03c0 radians) is called a full angle, complete angle, round angle or perigon.\nAn angle that is not a multiple of a right angle is called an oblique angle.The names, intervals, and measuring units are shown in the table below:\n\n\n=== Equivalence angle pairs ===\nAngles that have the same measure (i.e. the same magnitude) are said to be equal or congruent. An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all right angles are equal in measure).\nTwo angles that share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called coterminal angles.\nA reference angle is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle (1/2 turn, 180\u00b0, or \u03c0 radians), to the results as necessary, until the magnitude of the result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and 1/4 turn, 90\u00b0, or \u03c0/2 radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180\u00b0 \u2212 150\u00b0). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750\u00b0 \u2212 720\u00b0).\n\n\n=== Vertical and adjacent angle pairs ===\n\nWhen two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.\n\nA pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an \"X\"-like shape, are called vertical angles or opposite angles or vertically opposite angles. They are abbreviated as vert. opp. \u2220s.The equality of vertically opposite angles is called the vertical angle theorem. Eudemus of Rhodes attributed the proof to Thales of Miletus. The proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical note, when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as:\nAll straight angles are equal.\nEquals added to equals are equal.\nEquals subtracted from equals are equal.When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, if we assume that the measure of angle A equals x, then the measure of angle C would be 180\u00b0 \u2212 x. Similarly, the measure of angle D would be 180\u00b0 \u2212 x. Both angle C and angle D have measures equal to 180\u00b0 \u2212 x and are congruent. Since angle B is supplementary to both angles C and D, either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle B. Using the measure of either angle C or angle D, we find the measure of angle B to be 180\u00b0 \u2212 (180\u00b0 \u2212 x) = 180\u00b0 \u2212 180\u00b0 + x = x. Therefore, both angle A and angle B have measures equal to x and are equal in measure.\nAdjacent angles, often abbreviated as adj. \u2220s, are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle, or full angle are special and are respectively called complementary, supplementary and explementary angles (see \u00a7 Combining angle pairs below).A transversal is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines, and is associated with alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, interior angles, and exterior angles.\n\n\n=== Combining angle pairs ===\nThree special angle pairs involve the summation of angles:\n\nComplementary angles are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle (1/4 turn, 90\u00b0, or \u03c0/2 radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent, their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for 90 degrees.The adjective complementary is from Latin complementum, associated with the verb complere, \"to fill up\". An acute angle is \"filled up\" by its complement to form a right angle.\nThe difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the complement of the angle.\nIf angles A and B are complementary, the following relationships hold:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                  sin\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2061\n                A\n                +\n                \n                  sin\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2061\n                B\n                =\n                1\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  cos\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2061\n                A\n                +\n                \n                  cos\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2061\n                B\n                =\n                1\n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                tan\n                \u2061\n                A\n                =\n                cot\n                \u2061\n                B\n              \n              \n              \n                sec\n                \u2061\n                A\n                =\n                csc\n                \u2061\n                B\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}&\\sin ^{2}A+\\sin ^{2}B=1&&\\cos ^{2}A+\\cos ^{2}B=1\\\\[3pt]&\\tan A=\\cot B&&\\sec A=\\csc B\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n(The tangent of an angle equals the cotangent of its complement and its secant equals the cosecant of its complement.)\nThe prefix \"co-\" in the names of some trigonometric ratios refers to the word \"complementary\".\n\nTwo angles that sum to a straight angle (1/2 turn, 180\u00b0, or \u03c0 radians) are called supplementary angles.If the two supplementary angles are adjacent (i.e. have a common vertex and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a straight line. Such angles are called a linear pair of angles. However, supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line, and can be separated in space. For example, adjacent angles of a parallelogram are supplementary, and opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.\nIf a point P is exterior to a circle with center O, and if the tangent lines from P touch the circle at points T and Q, then \u2220TPQ and \u2220TOQ are supplementary.\nThe sines of supplementary angles are equal. Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\nIn Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n\nTwo angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360\u00b0, or 2\u03c0 radians) are called explementary angles or conjugate angles.\nThe difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the explement of the angle or conjugate of an angle.\n\n\n=== Polygon-related angles ===\n\nAn angle that is part of a simple polygon is called an interior angle if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple concave polygon has at least one interior angle that is a reflex angle.\nIn Euclidean geometry, the measures of the interior angles of a triangle add up to \u03c0 radians, 180\u00b0, or 1/2 turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex quadrilateral add up to 2\u03c0 radians, 360\u00b0, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex polygon with n sides add up to (n \u2212 2)\u03c0 radians, or (n \u2212 2)180 degrees, (n \u2212 2)2 right angles, or (n \u2212 2)1/2 turn.\nThe supplement of an interior angle is called an exterior angle, that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair of angles. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\nIn Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon, if only one of the two exterior angles is assumed at each vertex, will be one full turn (360\u00b0). The exterior angle here could be called a supplementary exterior angle. Exterior angles are commonly used in Logo Turtle programs when drawing regular polygons.\nIn a triangle, the bisectors of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are concurrent (meet at a single point).:\u200ap. 149\u200a\nIn a triangle, three intersection points, each of an external angle bisector with the opposite extended side, are collinear.:\u200ap. 149\u200a\nIn a triangle, three intersection points, two of them between an interior angle bisector and the opposite side, and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and the opposite side extended, are collinear.:\u200ap. 149\u200a\nSome authors use the name exterior angle of a simple polygon to mean the explement exterior angle (not supplement!) of the interior angle. This conflicts with the above usage.\n\n\n=== Plane-related angles ===\nThe angle between two planes (such as two adjacent faces of a polyhedron) is called a dihedral angle. It may be defined as the acute angle between two lines normal to the planes.\nThe angle between a plane and an intersecting straight line is equal to ninety degrees minus the angle between the intersecting line and the line that goes through the point of intersection and is normal to the plane.\n\n\n== Measuring angles ==\n\nThe size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are said to be equal or congruent or equal in measure.\nIn some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the orientation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full turn are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a spiral curve or describing the cumulative rotation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\nIn order to measure an angle \u03b8, a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of compasses. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the number of radians in the angle.  Conventionally, in mathematics and in the SI, the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless value 1.\nThe angle expressed another angular unit may then be obtained by multiplying the angle by a suitable conversion constant of the form k/2\u03c0, where k is the measure of a complete turn expressed in the chosen unit (for example, k = 360\u00b0 for degrees or 400 grad for gradians):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        =\n        \n          \n            k\n            \n              2\n              \u03c0\n            \n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          \n            s\n            r\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta ={\\frac {k}{2\\pi }}\\cdot {\\frac {s}{r}}.}\n  The value of \u03b8 thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio s/r is unaltered.\n\n\n=== Angle addition postulate ===\nThe angle addition postulate states that if B is in the interior of angle AOC, then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        \u2220\n        \n          A\n          O\n          C\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \u2220\n        \n          A\n          O\n          B\n        \n        +\n        m\n        \u2220\n        \n          B\n          O\n          C\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m\\angle \\mathrm {AOC} =m\\angle \\mathrm {AOB} +m\\angle \\mathrm {BOC} }\n  The measure of the angle AOC is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle BOC.\n\n\n=== Units ===\n\nThroughout history, angles have been measured in various units. These are known as angular units, with the most contemporary units being the degree ( \u00b0 ), the radian (rad), and the gradian (grad), though many others have been used throughout history. Most units of angular measurement are defined such that one turn (i.e. the angle subtended by the circumference of a circle at its centre) is equal to n units, for some whole number n.  Two exceptions are the radian (and its decimal submultiples) and the diameter part.\nIn the International System of Quantities, angle is defined as a dimensionless quantity, and in particular the radian unit is dimensionless. This convention impacts how angles are treated in dimensional analysis. For a discussion see Radian \u00a7 Dimensional analysis.\nThe following table list some units used to represent angles.\n\n\n=== Signed angles ===\n\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in opposite directions relative to some reference.\nIn a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The initial side is on the positive x-axis, while the other side or terminal side is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With positive angles representing rotations toward the positive y-axis and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative y-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position, defined by the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are anticlockwise and negative rotations are clockwise.\nIn many contexts, an angle of \u2212\u03b8 is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus \u03b8\". For example, an orientation represented as \u221245\u00b0 is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360\u00b0 \u2212 45\u00b0 or 315\u00b0.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of \u221245\u00b0 is not the same as a rotation of 315\u00b0 (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined in terms of an orientation, which is typically defined by a normal vector passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\nIn navigation, bearings or azimuth are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45\u00b0 corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315\u00b0.\n\n\n=== Alternative ways of measuring an angle ===\nFor an angular unit, it is definitional that the angle addition postulate holds. Some angle measurements where the angle addition postulate does not hold include:\n\nThe slope or gradient is equal to the tangent of the angle; a gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the slope of a line is approximately the measure in radians of its angle with the horizontal direction.\nThe spread between two lines is defined in rational geometry as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.\nAlthough done rarely, one can report the direct results of trigonometric functions, such as the sine of the angle.\n\n\n=== Astronomical approximations ===\n\nAstronomers measure apparent sizes of and distances between objects in degrees from their point of observation.\n\n0.5\u00b0 is the approximate diameter of the Sun and of the Moon as viewed from Earth.\n1\u00b0 is the approximate width of the little finger at arm's length.\n10\u00b0 is the approximate width of a closed fist at arm's length.\n20\u00b0 is the approximate width of a handspan at arm's length.These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough rule of thumb approximations only.\nIn astronomy, right ascension and declination are usually measured in angular units, expressed in terms of time, based on a 24-hour day.\n\n\n== Angles between curves ==\n\nThe angle between a line and a curve (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:\u2014amphicyrtic (Gr. \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af, on both sides, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, convex) or cissoidal (Gr. \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, ivy), biconvex; xystroidal or sistroidal (Gr. \u03be\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; amphicoelic (Gr. \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bb\u03b7, a hollow) or angulus lunularis, biconcave.\n\n\n== Bisecting and trisecting angles ==\n\nThe ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a compass and straightedge, but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837, Pierre Wantzel showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.\n\n\n== Dot product and generalisations ==\nIn the Euclidean space, the angle \u03b8 between two Euclidean vectors u and v is related to their dot product and their lengths by the formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          u\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n

The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite.\n\n\n== Angles in geography and astronomy ==\nIn geography, the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a geographic coordinate system. This system specifies the latitude and longitude of any location in terms of angles subtended at the center of the Earth, using the equator and (usually) the Greenwich meridian as references.\nIn astronomy, a given point on the celestial sphere (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several astronomical coordinate systems, where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the angular separation of two stars by imagining two lines through the center of the Earth, each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured and is the angular separation between the two stars.\nIn both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a vertical angle such as altitude /elevation with respect to the horizon as well as the azimuth with respect to north.\nAstronomers also measure the apparent size of objects as an angular diameter. For example, the full moon has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5\u00b0, when viewed from Earth. One could say, \"The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.\" The small-angle formula can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHenderson, David W.; Taimina, Daina (2005), Experiencing Geometry / Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History (3rd ed.), Pearson Prentice Hall, p. 104, ISBN 978-0-13-143748-7\nHeiberg, Johan Ludvig (1908),  Heath, T.

In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary, and is often called a polygon side. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces (or polyhedron sides) meet. A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal.\n\n\n== Relation to edges in graphs ==\nIn graph theory, an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices, unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment.\nHowever, any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges. Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs.\n\n\n== Number of edges in a polyhedron ==\nAny convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        \u2212\n        E\n        +\n        F\n        =\n        2\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V-E+F=2,}\n  where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula. Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.\n\n\n== Incidences with other faces ==\nIn a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex; more generally, by Balinski's theorem, at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d-dimensional convex polytope.\nSimilarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge, while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.\n\n\n== Alternative terminology ==\nIn the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes, a facet or side of a d-dimensional polytope is one of its (d \u2212 1)-dimensional features, a ridge is a (d \u2212 2)-dimensional feature, and a peak is a (d \u2212 3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges, and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExtended side\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Polygonal edge\". MathWorld.\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Polyhedral edge\". MathWorld.", "Cartesian_coordinate_system": "In geometry, a Cartesian coordinate system (UK: , US: ) in a plane is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely by a pair of real numbers called  coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, called coordinate lines, coordinate axes or just axes (plural of axis) of the system. The point where they meet is called the origin and has  (0, 0) as coordinates. \nSimilarly, the position of any point in three-dimensional space can be specified by three Cartesian coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to three mutually perpendicular planes. More generally, n Cartesian coordinates specify the point in an n-dimensional Euclidean space for any dimension n. These coordinates are the signed distances from the point to n mutually perpendicular fixed hyperplanes.\n\nCartesian coordinates are named for Ren\u00e9 Descartes whose invention of them in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between geometry and algebra. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as curves) can be described by equations involving the coordinates of points of the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2, centered at the origin of the plane, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates x and y satisfy the equation x2 + y2 = 4.\nCartesian coordinates are the foundation of analytic geometry, and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics, such as linear algebra, complex analysis, differential geometry, multivariate calculus, group theory and more. A familiar example is the concept of the graph of a function. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including astronomy, physics, engineering and many more. They are the most common coordinate system used in computer graphics, computer-aided geometric design and other geometry-related data processing.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe adjective Cartesian refers to the French mathematician and philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who published this idea in 1637 while he was resident in the Netherlands. It was independently discovered by Pierre de Fermat, who also worked in three dimensions, although Fermat did not publish the discovery. The French cleric Nicole Oresme used constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes and Fermat.Both Descartes and Fermat used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie was translated into Latin in 1649 by Frans van Schooten and his students. These commentators introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes's work.The development of the Cartesian coordinate system would play a fundamental role in the development of the calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The two-coordinate description of the plane was later generalized into the concept of vector spaces.Many other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes, such as the polar coordinates for the plane, and the spherical and cylindrical coordinates for three-dimensional space.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== One dimension ===\n\nChoosing a Cartesian coordinate system for a one-dimensional space\u2014that is, for a straight line\u2014involves choosing a point O of the line (the origin), a unit of length, and an orientation for the line. An orientation chooses which of the two half-lines determined by O is the positive and which is negative; we then say that the line \"is oriented\" (or \"points\") from the negative half towards the positive half. Then each point P of the line can be specified by its distance from O, taken with a + or \u2212 sign depending on which half-line contains P.\nA line with a chosen Cartesian system is called a number line. Every real number has a unique location on the line. Conversely, every point on the line can be interpreted as a number in an ordered continuum such as the real numbers.\n\n\n=== Two dimensions ===\n\nA Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions (also called a rectangular coordinate system or an orthogonal coordinate system) is defined by an ordered pair of perpendicular lines (axes), a single unit of length for both axes, and an orientation for each axis. The point where the axes meet is taken as the origin for both, thus turning each axis into a number line. For any point P, a line is drawn through P perpendicular to each axis, and the position where it meets the axis is interpreted as a number. The two numbers, in that chosen order, are the Cartesian coordinates of P. The reverse construction allows one to determine the point P given its coordinates.\nThe first and second coordinates are called the abscissa and the ordinate of P, respectively; and the point where the axes meet is called the origin of the coordinate system. The coordinates are usually written as two numbers in parentheses, in that order, separated by a comma, as in (3, \u221210.5). Thus the origin has coordinates (0, 0), and the points on the positive half-axes, one unit away from the origin, have coordinates (1, 0) and (0, 1).\nIn mathematics, physics, and engineering, the first axis is usually defined or depicted as horizontal and oriented to the right, and the second axis is vertical and oriented upwards. (However, in some computer graphics contexts, the ordinate axis may be oriented downwards.) The origin is often labeled O, and the two coordinates are often denoted by the letters X and Y, or x and y. The axes may then be referred to as the X-axis and Y-axis. The choices of letters come from the original convention, which is to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values. The first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values.\nA Euclidean plane with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system is called a Cartesian plane. In a Cartesian plane one can define canonical representatives of certain geometric figures, such as the unit circle (with radius equal to the length unit, and center at the origin), the unit square (whose diagonal has endpoints at (0, 0) and (1, 1)), the unit hyperbola, and so on.\nThe two axes divide the plane into four right angles, called quadrants. The quadrants may be named or numbered in various ways, but the quadrant where all coordinates are positive is usually called the first quadrant.\nIf the coordinates of a point are (x, y), then its distances from the X-axis and from the Y-axis are |y| and |x|, respectively; where | \u00b7 | denotes the absolute value of a number.\n\n\n=== Three dimensions ===\n\nA Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space consists of an ordered triplet of lines (the axes) that go through a common point (the origin), and are pair-wise perpendicular; an orientation for each axis; and a single unit of length for all three axes. As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line. For any point P of space, one considers a hyperplane through P perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and interprets the point where that hyperplane cuts the axis as a number. The Cartesian coordinates of P are those three numbers, in the chosen order. The reverse construction determines the point P given its three coordinates.\nAlternatively, each coordinate of a point P can be taken as the distance from P to the hyperplane defined by the other two axes, with the sign determined by the orientation of the corresponding axis.\nEach pair of axes defines a coordinate hyperplane. These hyperplanes divide space into eight octants. The octants are:\n\nThe coordinates are usually written as three numbers (or algebraic formulas) surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas, as in (3, \u22122.5, 1) or (t, u + v, \u03c0/2). Thus, the origin has coordinates (0, 0, 0), and the unit points on the three axes are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1).\nThere are no standard names for the coordinates in the three axes (however, the terms abscissa, ordinate and applicate are sometimes used). The coordinates are often denoted by the letters X, Y, and Z, or x, y, and z. The axes may then be referred to as the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis, respectively. Then the coordinate hyperplanes can be referred to as the XY-plane, YZ-plane, and XZ-plane.\nIn mathematics, physics, and engineering contexts, the first two axes are often defined or depicted as horizontal, with the third axis pointing up. In that case the third coordinate may be called height or altitude. The orientation is usually chosen so that the 90 degree angle from the first axis to the second axis looks counter-clockwise when seen from the point (0, 0, 1); a convention that is commonly called the right hand rule.\n\n\n=== Higher dimensions ===\nSince Cartesian coordinates are unique and non-ambiguous, the points of a Cartesian plane can be identified with pairs of real numbers; that is, with the Cartesian product \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}=\\mathbb {R} \\times \\mathbb {R} }\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n   is the set of all real numbers. In the same way, the points in any Euclidean space of dimension n be identified with the tuples (lists) of n real numbers; that is, with the Cartesian product \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n  .\n\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nThe concept of Cartesian coordinates generalizes to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other, and/or different units along each axis. In that case, each coordinate is obtained by projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis (or, in general, to the hyperplane defined by all the other axes). In such an oblique coordinate system the computations of distances and angles must be modified from that in standard Cartesian systems, and many standard formulas (such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance) do not hold (see affine plane).\n\n\n== Notations and conventions ==\nThe Cartesian coordinates of a point are usually written in parentheses and separated by commas, as in (10, 5) or (3, 5, 7). The origin is often labelled with the capital letter O. In analytic geometry, unknown or generic coordinates are often denoted by the letters (x, y) in the plane, and (x, y, z) in three-dimensional space. This custom comes from a convention of algebra, which uses letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values (such as the coordinates of points in many geometric problems), and letters near the beginning for given quantities.\nThese conventional names are often used in other domains, such as physics and engineering, although other letters may be used. For example, in a graph showing how a pressure varies with time, the graph coordinates may be denoted p and t. Each axis is usually named after the coordinate which is measured along it; so one says the x-axis, the y-axis, the t-axis, etc.\nAnother common convention for coordinate naming is to use subscripts, as (x1, x2, ..., xn) for the n coordinates in an n-dimensional space, especially when n is greater than 3 or unspecified. Some authors prefer the numbering (x0, x1, ..., xn\u22121). These notations are especially advantageous in computer programming: by storing the coordinates of a point as an array, instead of a record, the subscript can serve to index the coordinates.\nIn mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems, the first coordinate (traditionally called the abscissa) is measured along a horizontal axis, oriented from left to right. The second coordinate (the ordinate) is then measured along a vertical axis, usually oriented from bottom to top. Young children learning the Cartesian system, commonly learn the order to read the values before cementing the x-, y-, and z-axis concepts, by starting with 2D mnemonics (for example, 'Walk along the hall then up the stairs' akin to straight across the x-axis then up vertically along the y-axis).Computer graphics and image processing, however, often use a coordinate system with the y-axis oriented downwards on the computer display. This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in display buffers.\nFor three-dimensional systems, a convention is to portray the xy-plane horizontally, with the z-axis added to represent height (positive up). Furthermore, there is a convention to orient the x-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left. If a diagram (3D projection or 2D perspective drawing) shows the x- and y-axis horizontally and vertically, respectively, then the z-axis should be shown pointing \"out of the page\" towards the viewer or camera. In such a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system, the z-axis would appear as a line or ray pointing down and to the left or down and to the right, depending on the presumed viewer or camera perspective. In any diagram or display, the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary. However, the orientation of the axes relative to each other should always comply with the right-hand rule, unless specifically stated otherwise. All laws of physics and math assume this right-handedness, which ensures consistency.\nFor 3D diagrams, the names \"abscissa\" and \"ordinate\" are rarely used for x and y, respectively. When they are, the z-coordinate is sometimes called the applicate. The words abscissa, ordinate and applicate are sometimes used to refer to coordinate axes rather than the coordinate values.\n\n\n=== Quadrants and octants ===\n\nThe axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called quadrants, each bounded by two half-axes. These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by Roman numerals: I (where the coordinates both have positive signs), II (where the abscissa is negative \u2212 and the ordinate is positive +), III (where both the abscissa and the ordinate are \u2212), and IV (abscissa +, ordinate \u2212). When the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom, the numbering goes counter-clockwise starting from the upper right (\"north-east\") quadrant.\nSimilarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines a division of space into eight regions or octants, according to the signs of the coordinates of the points. The convention used for naming a specific octant is to list its signs; for example, (+ + +) or (\u2212 + \u2212). The generalization of the quadrant and octant to an arbitrary number of dimensions is the orthant, and a similar naming system applies.\n\n\n== Cartesian formulae for the plane ==\n\n\n=== Distance between two points ===\nThe Euclidean distance between two points of the plane with Cartesian coordinates \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})}\n   is\n\nThis is the Cartesian version of Pythagoras's theorem.

There are four types of these mappings (also called isometries): translations, rotations, reflections and glide reflections.\n\n\n==== Translation ====\nTranslating a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them, is equivalent to adding a fixed pair of numbers (a, b) to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set. That is, if the original coordinates of a point are (x, y), after the translation they will be\n\n\n==== Rotation ====\nTo rotate a figure counterclockwise around the origin by some angle \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (x,y) by the point with coordinates (x',y'), where\n\nThus:\n\n\n==== Reflection ====\nIf (x, y) are the Cartesian coordinates of a point, then (\u2212x, y) are the coordinates of its reflection across the second coordinate axis (the y-axis), as if that line were a mirror. Likewise, (x, \u2212y) are the coordinates of its reflection across the first coordinate axis (the x-axis). In more generality, reflection across a line through the origin making an angle \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   with the x-axis, is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (x, y) by the point with coordinates (x\u2032,y\u2032), where\n\nThus:\n\n\n==== Glide reflection ====\nA glide reflection is the composition of a reflection across a line followed by a translation in the direction of that line. It can be seen that the order of these operations does not matter (the translation can come first, followed by the reflection).\n\n\n==== General matrix form of the transformations ====\nAll affine transformations of the plane can be described in a uniform way by using matrices. For this purpose the coordinates \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n   of a point are commonly represented as the column matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  y\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}}.}\n   The result \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \u2032\n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \u2032\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x',y')}\n   of applying an affine transformation to a point \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n   is given by the formula\n\nwhere\n\nis a 2\u00d72 matrix and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      1\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b={\\begin{pmatrix}b_{1}\\\\b_{2}\\end{pmatrix}}}\n   is a column matrix.

If these conditions do not hold, the formula describes a more general affine transformation.\nThe transformation is a translation if and only if A is the identity matrix. The transformation is a rotation around some point if and only if A is a rotation matrix, meaning that it is orthogonal and\n\nA reflection or glide reflection is obtained when,\n\nAssuming that translations are not used (that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b_{1}=b_{2}=0}\n  ) transformations can be composed by simply multiplying the associated transformation matrices. In the general case, it is useful to use the augmented matrix of the transformation; that is, to rewrite the transformation formula \n\nwhere \n\nWith this trick, the composition of affine transformations is obtained by multiplying the augmented matrices.\n\n\n=== Affine transformation ===\n\nAffine transformations of the Euclidean plane are transformations that map lines to lines, but may change distances and angles. As said in the preceding section, they can be represented with augmented matrices:\n\nThe Euclidean transformations are the affine transformations such that the 2\u00d72 matrix of the \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{i,j}}\n   is orthogonal.\nThe augmented matrix that represents the composition of two affine transformations is obtained by multiplying their augmented matrices.\nSome affine transformations that are not Euclidean transformations have received specific names.\n\n\n==== Scaling ====\nAn example of an affine transformation which is not Euclidean is given by scaling. To make a figure larger or smaller is equivalent to multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number m. If (x, y) are the coordinates of a point on the original figure, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has coordinates\n\nIf m is greater than 1, the figure becomes larger; if m is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller.\n\n\n==== Shearing ====\nA shearing transformation will push the top of a square sideways to form a parallelogram. Horizontal shearing is defined by:\n\nShearing can also be applied vertically:\n\n\n== Orientation and handedness ==\n\n\n=== In two dimensions ===\n\nFixing or choosing the x-axis determines the y-axis up to direction. Namely, the y-axis is necessarily the perpendicular to the x-axis through the point marked 0 on the x-axis. But there is a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative. Each of these two choices determines a different orientation (also called handedness) of the Cartesian plane.\nThe usual way of orienting the plane, with the positive x-axis pointing right and the positive y-axis pointing up (and the x-axis being the \"first\" and the y-axis the \"second\" axis), is considered the positive or standard orientation, also called the right-handed orientation.\nA commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation is the right-hand rule. Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the x-axis to the y-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system.\nThe other way of orienting the plane is following the left hand rule, placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up.\nWhen pointing the thumb away from the origin along an axis towards positive, the curvature of the fingers indicates a positive rotation along that axis.\nRegardless of the rule used to orient the plane, rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation. Switching any one axis will reverse the orientation, but switching both will leave the orientation unchanged.\n\n\n=== In three dimensions ===\n\nOnce the x- and y-axes are specified, they determine the line along which the z-axis should lie, but there are two possible orientation for this line. The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'. The standard orientation, where the xy-plane is horizontal and the z-axis points up (and the x- and the y-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the xy-plane if observed from above the xy-plane) is called right-handed or positive.\n\nThe name derives from the right-hand rule. If the index finger of the right hand is pointed forward, the middle finger bent inward at a right angle to it, and the thumb placed at a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative orientation of the x-, y-, and z-axes in a right-handed system. The thumb indicates the x-axis, the index finger the y-axis and the middle finger the z-axis. Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.\nFigure 7 depicts a left and a right-handed coordinate system. Because a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen, distortion and ambiguity result. The axis pointing downward (and to the right) is also meant to point towards the observer, whereas the \"middle\"-axis is meant to point away from the observer. The red circle is parallel to the horizontal xy-plane and indicates rotation from the x-axis to the y-axis (in both cases). Hence the red arrow passes in front of the z-axis.\nFigure 8 is another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system. Again, there is an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane. Many observers see Figure 8 as \"flipping in and out\" between a convex cube and a concave \"corner\". This corresponds to the two possible orientations of the space. Seeing the figure as convex gives a left-handed coordinate system. Thus the \"correct\" way to view Figure 8 is to imagine the x-axis as pointing towards the observer and thus seeing a concave corner.\n\n\n== Representing a vector in the standard basis ==\nA point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system may also be represented by a position vector, which can be thought of as an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point. If the coordinates represent spatial positions (displacements), it is common to represent the vector from the origin to the point of interest as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} }\n  . In two dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates (x, y) can be written as:\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          i\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {i} ={\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          j\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {j} ={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}}}\n   are unit vectors in the direction of the x-axis and y-axis respectively, generally referred to as the standard basis (in some application areas these may also be referred to as versors).

In a two-dimensional cartesian plane, identify the point with coordinates (x, y) with the complex number z = x + iy. Here, i is the imaginary unit and is identified with the point with coordinates (0, 1), so it is not the unit vector in the direction of the x-axis. Since the complex numbers can be multiplied giving another complex number, this identification provides a means to \"multiply\" vectors. In a three-dimensional cartesian space a similar identification can be made with a subset of the quaternions.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nCartesian coordinates are an abstraction that have a multitude of possible applications in the real world. However, three constructive steps are involved in superimposing coordinates on a problem application. \n\nUnits of distance must be decided defining the spatial size represented by the numbers used as coordinates.\nAn origin must be assigned to a specific spatial location or landmark, and\nthe orientation of the axes must be defined using available directional cues for all but one axis.Consider as an example superimposing 3D Cartesian coordinates over all points on the Earth (that is, geospatial 3D). Kilometers are a good choice of units, since the original definition of the kilometer was geospatial, with 10,000 km equaling the surface distance from the equator to the North Pole. Based on symmetry, the gravitational center of the Earth suggests a natural placement of the origin (which can be sensed via satellite orbits). The axis of Earth's rotation provides a natural orientation for the X, Y, and Z axes, strongly associated with \"up vs. down\", so positive Z can adopt the direction from the geocenter to the North Pole. A location on the equator is needed to define the X-axis, and the prime meridian stands out as a reference orientation, so the X-axis takes the orientation from the geocenter out to 0 degrees longitude, 0 degrees latitude. Note that with three dimensions, and two perpendicular axes orientations pinned down for X and Z, the Y-axis is determined by the first two choices. In order to obey the right-hand rule, the Y-axis must point out from the geocenter to 90 degrees longitude, 0 degrees latitude. From a longitude of \u221273.985656 degrees, a latitude 40.748433 degrees, and Earth radius of 40,000/2\u03c0 km, and transforming from spherical to Cartesian coordinates, one can estimate the geocentric coordinates of the Empire State Building, (x, y, z) = (1,330.53 km, 4,635.75 km, 4,155.46 km). GPS navigation relies on such geocentric coordinates.\nIn engineering projects, agreement on the definition of coordinates is a crucial foundation. One cannot assume that coordinates come predefined for a novel application, so knowledge of how to erect a coordinate system where there previously was no such coordinate system is essential to applying Ren\u00e9 Descartes' thinking.\nWhile spatial applications employ identical units along all axes, in business and scientific applications, each axis may have different units of measurement associated with it (such as kilograms, seconds, pounds, etc.). Although four- and higher-dimensional spaces are difficult to visualize, the algebra of Cartesian coordinates can be extended relatively easily to four or more variables, so that certain calculations involving many variables can be done. (This sort of algebraic extension is what is used to define the geometry of higher-dimensional spaces.) Conversely, it is often helpful to use the geometry of Cartesian coordinates in two or three dimensions to visualize algebraic relationships between two or three of many non-spatial variables.\nThe graph of a function or relation is the set of all points satisfying that function or relation. For a function of one variable, f, the set of all points (x, y), where y = f(x) is the graph of the function f. For a function g of two variables, the set of all points (x, y, z), where z = g(x, y) is the graph of the function g. A sketch of the graph of such a function or relation would consist of all the salient parts of the function or relation which would include its relative extrema, its concavity and points of inflection, any points of discontinuity and its end behavior. All of these terms are more fully defined in calculus. Such graphs are useful in calculus to understand the nature and behavior of a function or relation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHorizontal and vertical\nJones diagram, which plots four variables rather than two\nOrthogonal coordinates\nPolar coordinate system\nRegular grid\nSpherical coordinate system\nCartesian coordinate robot\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBrannan, David A.; Esplen, Matthew F.; Gray, Jeremy J.

The points where two edges meet are the polygon's vertices or corners. The interior of a solid polygon is its body. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon.\nA simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself. Mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding polygonal chains of simple polygons and they often define a polygon accordingly. A polygonal boundary may be allowed to cross over itself, creating star polygons and other self-intersecting polygons.\nA polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. There are many more generalizations of polygons defined for different purposes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word polygon derives from the Greek adjective \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 (pol\u00fas) 'much', 'many' and \u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 (g\u014dn\u00eda) 'corner' or 'angle'. It has been suggested that \u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03c5 (g\u00f3nu) 'knee' may be the origin of gon.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Number of sides ===\nPolygons are primarily classified by the number of sides.\n\n\n=== Convexity and intersection ===\nPolygons may be characterized by their convexity or type of non-convexity:\n\nConvex: any line drawn through the polygon (and not tangent to an edge or corner) meets its boundary exactly twice. As a consequence, all its interior angles are less than 180\u00b0. Equivalently, any line segment with endpoints on the boundary passes through only interior points between its endpoints. This condition is true for polygons in any geometry, not just Euclidean.\nNon-convex: a line may be found which meets its boundary more than twice. Equivalently, there exists a line segment between two boundary points that passes outside the polygon.\nSimple: the boundary of the polygon does not cross itself. All convex polygons are simple.\nConcave: Non-convex and simple. There is at least one interior angle greater than 180\u00b0.\nStar-shaped: the whole interior is visible from at least one point, without crossing any edge. The polygon must be simple, and may be convex or concave. All convex polygons are star-shaped.\nSelf-intersecting: the boundary of the polygon crosses itself. The term complex is sometimes used in contrast to simple, but this usage risks confusion with the idea of a complex polygon as one which exists in the complex Hilbert plane consisting of two complex dimensions.\nStar polygon: a polygon which self-intersects in a regular way. A polygon cannot be both a star and star-shaped.\n\n\n=== Equality and symmetry ===\nEquiangular: all corner angles are equal.\nEquilateral: all edges are of the same length.\nRegular: both equilateral and equiangular.\nCyclic: all corners lie on a single circle, called the circumcircle.\nTangential: all sides are tangent to an inscribed circle.\nIsogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular.\nIsotoxal or edge-transitive: all sides lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also equilateral and tangential.The property of regularity may be defined in other ways: a polygon is regular if and only if it is both isogonal and isotoxal, or equivalently it is both cyclic and equilateral. A non-convex regular polygon is called a regular star polygon.\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nRectilinear: the polygon's sides meet at right angles, i.e. all its interior angles are 90 or 270 degrees.\nMonotone with respect to a given line L: every line orthogonal to L intersects the polygon not more than twice.\n\n\n== Properties and formulas ==\n\nEuclidean geometry is assumed throughout.\n\n\n=== Angles ===\nAny polygon has as many corners as it has sides. Each corner has several angles. The two most important ones are:\n\nInterior angle \u2013 The sum of the interior angles of a simple n-gon is (n \u2212 2) \u00d7 \u03c0 radians or (n \u2212 2) \u00d7 180 degrees. This is because any simple n-gon ( having n sides ) can be considered to be made up of (n \u2212 2) triangles, each of which has an angle sum of \u03c0 radians or 180 degrees. The measure of any interior angle of a convex regular n-gon is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            1\n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                \n                  2\n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(1-{\\tfrac {2}{n}}\\right)\\pi }\n   radians or \n  \n    \n      \n        180\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              360\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 180-{\\tfrac {360}{n}}}\n   degrees.

Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle \"turned\" at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing all the way around the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360\u00b0. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360\u00b0, e.g. 720\u00b0 for a pentagram and 0\u00b0 for an angular \"eight\" or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or turning number of the polygon.\n\n\n=== Area ===\n\nIn this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            n\n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0}),(x_{1},y_{1}),\\ldots ,(x_{n-1},y_{n-1})}\n   in order.

Commonly, the positive orientation is defined by the (counterclockwise) rotation that maps the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis. If the vertices are ordered counterclockwise (that is, according to positive orientation), the signed area is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In either case, the area formula is correct in absolute value. This is commonly called the shoelace formula or surveyor's formula.The area A of a simple polygon can also be computed if the lengths of the sides, a1, a2, ..., an and the exterior angles, \u03b81,

simple formula for the polygon's area based on the numbers of interior and boundary grid points: the former number plus one-half the latter number, minus 1.\nIn every polygon with perimeter p and area

form the second polygon.\nThe lengths of the sides of a polygon do not in general determine its area. However, if the polygon is simple and cyclic then the sides do determine the area. Of all n-gons with given side lengths, the one with the largest area is cyclic. Of all n-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is regular (and therefore cyclic).\n\n\n==== Regular polygons ====\nMany specialized formulas apply to the areas of regular polygons.\nThe area of a regular polygon is given in terms of the radius r of its inscribed circle and its perimeter p by \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        p\n        \u22c5\n        r\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A={\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\cdot p\\cdot r.}\n  This radius is also termed its apothem and is often represented as a.\nThe area of a regular n-gon in terms of the radius R of its circumscribed circle can be expressed trigonometrically as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          \n            n\n            2\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              \u03c0\n            \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        n\n        \u22c5\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            n\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=R^{2}\\cdot {\\frac {n}{2}}\\cdot \\sin {\\frac {2\\pi }{n}}=R^{2}\\cdot n\\cdot \\sin {\\frac {\\pi }{n}}\\cdot \\cos {\\frac {\\pi }{n}}}\n  The area of a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit-radius circle, with side s and interior angle \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha ,}\n   can also be expressed trigonometrically as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                s\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            4\n          \n        \n        cot\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                s\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            4\n          \n        \n        cot\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            \n              n\n              \u2212\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        n\n        \u22c5\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            \n              n\n              \u2212\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            \n              n\n              \u2212\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {ns^{2}}{4}}\\cot {\\frac {\\pi }{n}}={\\frac {ns^{2}}{4}}\\cot {\\frac {\\alpha }{n-2}}=n\\cdot \\sin {\\frac {\\alpha }{n-2}}\\cdot \\cos {\\frac {\\alpha }{n-2}}.}\n  \n\n\n==== Self-intersecting ====\nThe area of a self-intersecting polygon can be defined in two different ways, giving different answers:\n\nUsing the formulas for simple polygons, we allow that particular regions within the polygon may have their area multiplied by a factor which we call the density of the region. For example, the central convex pentagon in the center of a pentagram has density 2. The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure.\nConsidering the enclosed regions as point sets, we can find the area of the enclosed point set. This corresponds to the area of the plane covered by the polygon or to the area of one or more simple polygons having the same outline as the self-intersecting one. In the case of the cross-quadrilateral, it is treated as two simple triangles.\n\n\n=== Centroid ===\nUsing the same convention for vertex coordinates as in the previous section, the coordinates of the centroid of a solid simple polygon are \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              6\n              A\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            0\n          \n          \n            n\n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{x}={\\frac {1}{6A}}\\sum _{i=0}^{n-1}(x_{i}+x_{i+1})(x_{i}y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_{i}),}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            y\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              6\n              A\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            0\n          \n          \n            n\n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{y}={\\frac {1}{6A}}\\sum _{i=0}^{n-1}(y_{i}+y_{i+1})(x_{i}y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_{i}).}\n  In these formulas, the signed value of area \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   must be used.\nFor triangles (n = 3), the centroids of the vertices and of the solid shape are the same, but, in general, this is not true for n > 3.

Some of the more important include:\n\nA spherical polygon is a circuit of arcs of great circles (sides) and vertices on the surface of a sphere. It allows the digon, a polygon having only two sides and two corners, which is impossible in a flat plane. Spherical polygons play an important role in cartography (map making) and in Wythoff's construction of the uniform polyhedra.\nA skew polygon does not lie in a flat plane, but zigzags in three (or more) dimensions. The Petrie polygons of the regular polytopes are well known examples.\nAn apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles, which is not closed but has no ends because it extends indefinitely in both directions.\nA skew apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles that do not lie in a flat plane.\nA complex polygon is a configuration analogous to an ordinary polygon, which exists in the complex plane of two real and two imaginary dimensions.\nAn abstract polygon is an algebraic partially ordered set representing the various elements (sides, vertices, etc.) and their connectivity. A real geometric polygon is said to be a realization of the associated abstract polygon. Depending on the mapping, all the generalizations described here can be realized.\nA polyhedron is a three-dimensional solid bounded by flat polygonal faces, analogous to a polygon in two dimensions. The corresponding shapes in four or higher dimensions are called polytopes. (In other conventions, the words polyhedron and polytope are used in any dimension, with the distinction between the two that a polytope is necessarily bounded.)\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThe word polygon comes from Late Latin polyg\u014dnum (a noun), from Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (polyg\u014dnon/polug\u014dnon), noun use of neuter of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (polyg\u014dnos/polug\u014dnos, the masculine adjective), meaning \"many-angled\". Individual polygons are named (and sometimes classified) according to the number of sides, combining a Greek-derived numerical prefix with the suffix -gon, e.g. pentagon, dodecagon. The triangle, quadrilateral and nonagon are exceptions.\nBeyond decagons (10-sided) and dodecagons (12-sided), mathematicians generally use numerical notation, for example 17-gon and 257-gon.Exceptions exist for side counts that are easily expressed in verbal form (e.g. 20 and 30), or are used by non-mathematicians. Some special polygons also have their own names; for example the regular star pentagon is also known as the pentagram.\n\nTo construct the name of a polygon with more than 20 and less than 100 edges, combine the prefixes as follows. The \"kai\" term applies to 13-gons and higher and was used by Kepler, and advocated by John H. Conway for clarity of concatenated prefix numbers in the naming of quasiregular polyhedra, though not all sources use it.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPolygons have been known since ancient times. The regular polygons were known to the ancient Greeks, with the pentagram, a non-convex regular polygon (star polygon), appearing as early as the 7th century B.C. on a krater by Aristophanes, found at Caere and now in the Capitoline Museum.The first known systematic study of non-convex polygons in general was made by Thomas Bradwardine in the 14th century.In 1952, Geoffrey Colin Shephard generalized the idea of polygons to the complex plane, where each real dimension is accompanied by an imaginary one, to create complex polygons.\n\n\n== In nature ==\n\nPolygons appear in rock formations, most commonly as the flat facets of crystals, where the angles between the sides depend on the type of mineral from which the crystal is made.\nRegular hexagons can occur when the cooling of lava forms areas of tightly packed columns of basalt, which may be seen at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, or at the Devil's Postpile in California.\nIn biology, the surface of the wax honeycomb made by bees is an array of hexagons, and the sides and base of each cell are also polygons.\n\n\n== Computer graphics ==\n\nIn computer graphics, a polygon is a primitive used in modelling and rendering. They are defined in a database, containing arrays of vertices (the coordinates of the geometrical vertices, as well as other attributes of the polygon, such as color, shading and texture), connectivity information, and materials.Any surface is modelled as a tessellation called polygon mesh. If a square mesh has n + 1 points (vertices) per side, there are n squared squares in the mesh, or 2n squared triangles since there are two triangles in a square. There are (n + 1)2 / 2(n2) vertices per triangle. Where n is large, this approaches one half. Or, each vertex inside the square mesh connects four edges (lines).\nThe imaging system calls up the structure of polygons needed for the scene to be created from the database. This is transferred to active memory and finally, to the display system (screen, TV monitors etc.) so that the scene can be viewed. During this process, the imaging system renders polygons in correct perspective ready for transmission of the processed data to the display system. Although polygons are two-dimensional, through the system computer they are placed in a visual scene in the correct three-dimensional orientation.\nIn computer graphics and computational geometry, it is often necessary to determine whether a given point \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P=(x_{0},y_{0})}\n   lies inside a simple polygon given by a sequence of line segments. This is called the point in polygon test.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nCoxeter, H.S.M.; Regular Polytopes, Methuen and Co., 1948 (3rd Edition, Dover, 1973).\nCromwell, P.; Polyhedra, CUP hbk (1997), pbk.

In modern mathematics, a point refers more generally to an element of some set called a space.\nBeing a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy; for example, \"there is exactly one line that passes through two different points\".\n\n\n== Points in Euclidean geometry ==\n\nPoints, considered within the framework of Euclidean geometry, are one of the most fundamental objects. Euclid originally defined the point as \"that which has no part\". In the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, a point is represented by an ordered pair (x,\u2009y) of numbers, where the first number conventionally represents the horizontal and is often denoted by x, and the second number conventionally represents the vertical and is often denoted by y. This idea is easily generalized to three-dimensional Euclidean space, where a point is represented by an ordered triplet (x,\u2009y,\u2009z) with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by z. Further generalizations are represented by an ordered tuplet of n terms, (a1,\u2009a2,\u2009\u2026\u2009,\u2009an) where n is the dimension of the space in which the point is located.Many constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an infinite collection of points that conform to certain axioms.  This is usually represented by a set of points; As an example, a line is an infinite set of points of the form\nwhere c1 through cn and d are constants and n is the dimension of the space. Similar constructions exist that define the plane, line segment, and other related concepts. A line segment consisting of only a single point is called a degenerate line segment.In addition to defining points and constructs related to points, Euclid also postulated a key idea about points, that any two points can be connected by a straight line. This is easily confirmed under modern extensions of Euclidean geometry, and had lasting consequences at its introduction, allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts known at the time. However, Euclid's postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive, and he occasionally assumed facts about points that did not follow directly from his axioms, such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points. In spite of this, modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions.\n\n\n== Dimension of a point ==\nThere are several inequivalent definitions of dimension  in mathematics. In all of the common definitions, a point is 0-dimensional.\n\n\n=== Vector space dimension ===\n\nThe dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a linearly independent subset. In a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector 0), there is no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent, because there is a non-trivial linear combination making it zero: \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        \u22c5\n        \n          0\n        \n        =\n        \n          0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1\\cdot \\mathbf {0} =\\mathbf {0} }\n  .\n\n\n=== Topological dimension ===\n\nThe topological dimension of a topological space \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   is defined to be the minimum value of n, such that every finite open cover \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   admits a finite open cover \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}}\n   of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   which refines \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   in which no point is included in more than n+1 elements. If no such minimal n exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.\nA point is zero-dimensional with respect to the covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of a single open set.\n\n\n=== Hausdorff dimension ===\nLet X be a metric space. If S \u2282 X and d \u2208 [0, \u221e), the d-dimensional Hausdorff content of S is the infimum of the set of numbers \u03b4 \u2265 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of balls \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        B\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          r\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        :\n        i\n        \u2208\n        I\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{B(x_{i},r_{i}):i\\in I\\}}\n   covering S with ri > 0 for each i \u2208 I that satisfies \nThe Hausdorff dimension of X is defined by\n\nA point has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily small radius.\n\n\n== Geometry without points ==\nAlthough the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology, there are some systems that forgo it, e.g. noncommutative geometry and pointless topology. A \"pointless\" or \"pointfree\" space is defined not as a set, but via some structure (algebraic or logical respectively) which looks like a well-known function space on the set: an algebra of continuous functions or an algebra of sets respectively. More precisely, such structures generalize well-known spaces of functions in a way that the operation \"take a value at this point\" may not be defined. A further tradition starts from some books of A. N. Whitehead in which the notion of region is assumed as a primitive together with the one of inclusion or connection.\n\n\n== Point masses and the Dirac delta function ==\n\nOften in physics and mathematics, it is useful to think of a point as having non-zero mass or charge (this is especially common in classical electromagnetism, where electrons are idealized as points with non-zero charge). The Dirac delta function, or \u03b4 function, is (informally) a generalized function on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero, with an integral of one over the entire real line. The delta function is sometimes thought of as an infinitely high, infinitely thin spike at the origin, with total area one under the spike, and physically represents an idealized point mass or point charge. It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac.  In the context of signal processing it is often referred to as the unit impulse symbol (or function). Its discrete analog is the Kronecker delta function which is usually defined on a finite domain and takes values 0 and 1.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Point\". PlanetMath.\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Point\". MathWorld.", "Grade_(slope)": "The grade (also called slope, incline, gradient, mainfall, pitch or rise) of a physical feature, landform or constructed line refers to the tangent of the angle of that surface to the horizontal. It is a special case of the slope, where zero indicates horizontality. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of \"tilt\". Often slope is calculated as a ratio of \"rise\" to \"run\", or as a fraction (\"rise over run\") in which run is the horizontal distance (not the distance along the slope) and rise is the vertical distance.\nSlopes of existing physical features such as canyons and hillsides, stream and river banks and beds are often described as grades, but typically grades are used for human-made surfaces such as roads, landscape grading, roof pitches, railroads, aqueducts, and pedestrian or bicycle routes. The grade may refer to the longitudinal slope or the perpendicular cross slope.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThere are several ways to express slope:\n\nas an angle of inclination to the horizontal. (This is the angle \u03b1 opposite the \"rise\" side of a triangle with a right angle between vertical rise and horizontal run.)\nas a percentage, the formula for which is \n  \n    \n      \n        100\n        \u00d7\n        \n          \n            rise\n            run\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 100\\times {\\frac {\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}}}\n   which is equivalent to the tangent of the angle of inclination times 100. In Europe and the U.S. percentage \"grade\" is the most commonly used figure for describing slopes.\nas a per mille figure (\u2030), the formula for which is \n  \n    \n      \n        1000\n        \u00d7\n        \n          \n            rise\n            run\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1000\\times {\\frac {\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}}}\n   which could also be expressed as the tangent of the angle of inclination times 1000. This is commonly used in Europe to denote the incline of a railway.  It is sometimes written as mm/m instead of the \u2030 symbol.\nas a ratio of one part rise to so many parts run. For example, a slope that has a rise of 5 feet for every 1000 feet of run would have a slope ratio of 1 in 200.  (The word \"in\" is normally used rather than the mathematical ratio notation of \"1:200\".) This is generally the method used to describe railway grades in Australia and the UK. It is used for roads in Hong Kong, and was used for roads in the UK until the 1970s.\nas a ratio of many parts run to one part rise, which is the inverse of the previous expression (depending on the country and the industry standards). For example, \"slopes are expressed as ratios such as 4:1. This means that for every 4 units (feet or metres) of horizontal distance there is a 1 unit (foot or metre) vertical change either up or down.\"Any of these may be used. Grade is usually expressed as a percentage, but this is easily converted to the angle \u03b1 by taking the inverse tangent of the standard mathematical slope, which is rise / run or the grade / 100. If one looks at red numbers on the chart specifying grade, one can see the quirkiness of using the grade to specify slope; the numbers go from 0 for flat, to 100% at 45 degrees, to infinity as it approaches vertical.\nSlope may still be expressed when the horizontal run is not known: the rise can be divided by the hypotenuse (the slope length). This is not the usual way to specify slope; this nonstandard expression follows the sine function rather than the tangent function, so it calls a 45 degree slope a 71 percent grade instead of a 100 percent. But in practice the usual way to calculate slope is to measure the distance along the slope and the vertical rise, and calculate the horizontal run from that, in order to calculate the grade (100% \u00d7 rise/run) or standard slope (rise/run). When the angle of inclination is small, using the slope length rather than the horizontal displacement (i.e., using the sine of the angle rather than the tangent) makes only an insignificant difference and can then be used as an approximation. Railway gradients are often expressed in terms of the rise in relation to the distance along the track as a practical measure. In cases where the difference between sin and tan is significant, the tangent is used. In either case, the following identity holds for all inclinations up to 90 degrees:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \u03b1\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              sin\n              \u2061\n              \n                \u03b1\n              \n            \n            \n              1\n              \u2212\n              \n                sin\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2061\n              \n                \u03b1\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan {\\alpha }={\\frac {\\sin {\\alpha }}{\\sqrt {1-\\sin ^{2}{\\alpha }}}}}\n  . Or more simply, one can calculate the horizontal run by using the Pythagorean theorem, after which it is trivial to calculate the (standard math) slope or the grade (percentage).\nIn Europe, road gradients are signed as a percentage.\n\n\n=== Equations ===\nGrades are related using the following equations with symbols from the figure at top.\n\n\n==== Tangent as a ratio ====\n\n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \u03b1\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u0394\n              h\n            \n            d\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan {\\alpha }={\\frac {\\Delta h}{d}}}\n  The slope expressed as a percentage can similarly be determined from the tangent of the angle:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        %\n        \n        \n          slope\n        \n        =\n        100\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \u03b1\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\%\\,{\\text{slope}}=100\\tan {\\alpha }}\n  \n\n\n==== Angle from a tangent gradient ====\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n        =\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \n              \u0394\n              h\n            \n            d\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha =\\arctan {\\frac {\\Delta h}{d}}}\n  If the tangent is expressed as a percentage, the angle can be determined as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n        =\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \n              %\n              \n              \n                slope\n              \n            \n            100\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha =\\arctan {\\frac {\\%\\,{\\text{slope}}}{100}}}\n  If the angle is expressed as a ratio (1 in n) then:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n        =\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            1\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha =\\arctan {\\frac {1}{n}}}\n  \n\n\n=== Example slopes comparing the notations ===\nFor degrees, percentage (%) and per-mille (\u2030) notations, larger numbers are steeper slopes.  For ratios, larger numbers n of 1 in n are shallower, easier slopes.  \nThe examples show round numbers in one or more of the notations and some documented and reasonably well known instances.  \n\n\n== Roads ==\nIn vehicular engineering, various land-based designs (automobiles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, trains, etc.) are rated for their ability to ascend terrain. Trains typically rate much lower than automobiles.  The highest grade a vehicle can ascend while maintaining a particular speed is sometimes termed that vehicle's \"gradeability\" (or, less often, \"grade ability\"). The lateral slopes of a highway geometry are sometimes called fills or cuts where these techniques have been used to create them.\nIn the United States, maximum grade for Federally funded highways is specified in a design table based on terrain and design speeds, with up to 6% generally allowed in mountainous areas and hilly urban areas with exceptions for up to 7% grades on mountainous roads with speed limits below 60 mph (95 km/h).\nThe steepest roads in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records are Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand, Ffordd Pen Llech in Harlech, Wales and Canton Avenue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Guinness World Record once again lists Baldwin Street as the steepest street in the world, with a 34.8% grade (1 in 2.87) after a successful appeal against the ruling that handed the title, briefly, to Ffordd Pen Llech.  \nA number of streets elsewhere have steeper grades than those listed in the Guinness Book. Drawing on the U.S. National Elevation Dataset, 7x7 (magazine) identified ten blocks of public streets in San Francisco open to vehicular traffic in the city with grades over 30 percent. The steepest at 41 percent is the block of Bradford Street above Tompkins Avenue in the Bernal Heights neighborhood. The San Francisco Municipal Railway operates bus service among the city's hills. The steepest grade for bus operations is 23.1% by the 67-Bernal Heights on Alabama Street between Ripley and Esmeralda Streets.Likewise, the Pittsburgh Department of Engineering and Construction recorded a grade of 37% (20\u00b0) for Canton Avenue. The street has formed part of a bicycle race since 1983.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Environmental design ==\nGrade, pitch, and slope are important components in landscape design, garden design, landscape architecture, and architecture; for engineering and aesthetic design factors. Drainage, slope stability, circulation of people and vehicles, complying with building codes, and design integration are all aspects of slope considerations in environmental design.\n\n\n== Railways ==\n\nRuling gradients limit the load that a locomotive can haul, including the weight of the locomotive itself. On a 1% gradient (1 in 100) a locomotive can pull half (or less) of the load that it can pull on level track. (A heavily loaded train rolling at 20 km/h on heavy rail may require ten times the pull on a 1% upgrade that it does on the level at that speed.)\nEarly railways in the United Kingdom were laid out with very gentle gradients, such as 0.07575% (1 in 1320) and 0.1515% (1 in 660) on the Great Western main line, nicknamed Brunel's Billiard Table, because the early locomotives (and their brakes) were feeble. Steep gradients were concentrated in short sections of lines where it was convenient to employ assistant engines or cable haulage, such as the 1.2 kilometres (0.75 miles) section from Euston to Camden Town.\nExtremely steep gradients require the use of cables (such as the Scenic Railway at Katoomba Scenic World, Australia, with a maximum grade of 122% (52\u00b0), claimed to be the world's steepest passenger-carrying funicular) or some kind of rack railway (such as the Pilatus railway in Switzerland, with a maximum grade of 48% (26\u00b0), claimed to be the world's steepest rack railway) to help the train ascend or descend.\nGradients can be expressed as an angle, as feet per mile, feet per chain, 1 in n, x% or y per mille. Since designers like round figures, the method of expression can affect the gradients selected.\n\nThe steepest railway lines that do not use a rack system include:\n\n13.5% (1 in 7.40) \u2013 Lisbon tram, Portugal\n11.6% (1 in 8.62) \u2013 P\u00f6stlingbergbahn, Linz, Austria\n11.0% (1 in 9.09) \u2013 Cass Scenic Railway, US (former logging line)\n9.0% (1 in 11.11) \u2013 Ligne de Saint Gervais \u2013 Vallorcine, France\n9.0% (1 in 11.11) \u2013 Muni Metro J Church, San Francisco, US\n8.8% (1 in 11.4) \u2013 Ia\u0219i tram, Romania\n8.65% (1 in 11.95) \u2013 Portland Streetcar, Oregon, US\n8.33%(1 in 12) \u2013 Nilgiri Mountain Railway Tamil Nadu, India\n8.0% (1 in 12.5) \u2013 Just outside the Tobstone Jct.

In those days, for example, an inspector insisted that Rudgwick railway station in West Sussex be regraded. He would not allow it to open until the gradient through the platform was eased from 1 in 80 to 1 in 130.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"British railway gradients and their signs\".

The word is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning \"side\". It is also called a tetragon, derived from greek \"tetra\" meaning \"four\" and \"gon\" meaning \"corner\" or \"angle\", in analogy to other polygons (e.g. pentagon). Since \"gon\" means \"angle\", it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle.

Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave.\nThe interior angles of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral ABCD add up to 360 degrees of arc, that is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2220\n        A\n        +\n        \u2220\n        B\n        +\n        \u2220\n        C\n        +\n        \u2220\n        D\n        =\n        \n          360\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C+\\angle D=360^{\\circ }.}\n  This is a special case of the n-gon interior angle sum formula: S = (n \u2212 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0.All non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.\n\n\n== Simple quadrilaterals ==\nAny quadrilateral that is not self-intersecting is a simple quadrilateral.\n\n\n=== Convex quadrilateral ===\n\nIn a convex quadrilateral all interior angles are less than 180\u00b0, and the two diagonals both lie inside the quadrilateral.\n\nIrregular quadrilateral (British English) or trapezium (North American English): no sides are parallel.  (In British English, this was once called a trapezoid. For more, see Trapezoid \u00a7 Trapezium vs Trapezoid)\nTrapezium (UK) or trapezoid (US): at least one pair of opposite sides are parallel.  Trapezia (UK) and trapezoids (US) include parallelograms.\nIsosceles trapezium (UK) or isosceles trapezoid (US): one pair of opposite sides are parallel and the base angles are equal in measure. Alternative definitions are a quadrilateral with an axis of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides, or a trapezoid with diagonals of equal length.\nParallelogram: a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Equivalent conditions are that opposite sides are of equal length; that opposite angles are equal; or that the diagonals bisect each other.  Parallelograms include rhombi (including those rectangles called squares) and rhomboids (including those rectangles called oblongs).  In other words, parallelograms include all rhombi and all rhomboids, and thus also include all rectangles.\nRhombus, rhomb: all four sides are of equal length (equilateral). An equivalent condition is that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other.  Informally: \"a pushed-over square\" (but strictly including a square, too).\nRhomboid: a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths, and some angles are oblique (equiv., having no right angles). Informally: \"a pushed-over oblong\". Not all references agree, some define a rhomboid as a parallelogram that is not a rhombus.\nRectangle: all four angles are right angles (equiangular). An equivalent condition is that the diagonals bisect each other, and are equal in length.  Rectangles include squares and oblongs. Informally: \"a box or oblong\" (including a square).\nSquare (regular quadrilateral): all four sides are of equal length (equilateral), and all four angles are right angles. An equivalent condition is that opposite sides are parallel (a square is a parallelogram), and that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other and are of equal length. A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is both a rhombus and a rectangle (i.e., four equal sides and four equal angles).\nOblong: longer than wide, or wider than long (i.e., a rectangle that is not a square).\nKite: two pairs of adjacent sides are of equal length. This implies that one diagonal divides the kite into congruent triangles, and so the angles between the two pairs of equal sides are equal in measure. It also implies that the diagonals are perpendicular. Kites include rhombi.\n\nTangential quadrilateral: the four sides are tangents to an inscribed circle. A convex quadrilateral is tangential if and only if opposite sides have equal sums.\nTangential trapezoid: a trapezoid where the four sides are tangents to an inscribed circle.\nCyclic quadrilateral: the four vertices lie on a circumscribed circle. A convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if opposite angles sum to 180\u00b0.\nRight kite: a kite with two opposite right angles. It is a type of cyclic quadrilateral.\nHarmonic quadrilateral: the products of the lengths of the opposing sides are equal. It is a type of cyclic quadrilateral.\nBicentric quadrilateral: it is both tangential and cyclic.\nOrthodiagonal quadrilateral: the diagonals cross at right angles.\nEquidiagonal quadrilateral: the diagonals are of equal length.\nEx-tangential quadrilateral: the four extensions of the sides are tangent to an excircle.\nAn equilic quadrilateral has two opposite equal sides that when extended, meet at 60\u00b0.\nA Watt quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with a pair of opposite sides of equal length.\nA quadric quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral whose four vertices all lie on the perimeter of a square.\nA diametric quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral having one of its sides as a diameter of the circumcircle.\nA Hjelmslev quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with two right angles at opposite vertices.\n\n\n=== Concave quadrilaterals ===\nIn a concave quadrilateral, one interior angle is bigger than 180\u00b0, and one of the two diagonals lies outside the quadrilateral.\n\nA dart (or arrowhead) is a concave quadrilateral with bilateral symmetry like a kite, but where one interior angle is reflex. See Kite.\n\n\n== Complex quadrilaterals ==\n\nA self-intersecting quadrilateral is called variously a cross-quadrilateral, crossed quadrilateral, butterfly quadrilateral or bow-tie quadrilateral. In a crossed quadrilateral, the four \"interior\" angles on either side of the crossing (two acute and two reflex, all on the left or all on the right as the figure is traced out) add up to 720\u00b0.\nCrossed trapezoid (US) or trapezium (Commonwealth): a crossed quadrilateral in which one pair of nonadjacent sides is parallel (like a trapezoid)\nAntiparallelogram: a crossed quadrilateral in which each pair of nonadjacent sides have equal lengths (like a parallelogram)\nCrossed rectangle: an antiparallelogram whose sides are two opposite sides and the two diagonals of a rectangle, hence having one pair of parallel opposite sides\nCrossed square: a special case of a crossed rectangle where two of the sides intersect at right angles\n\n\n== Special line segments ==\nThe two diagonals of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect opposite vertices.\nThe two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides. They intersect at the \"vertex centroid\" of the quadrilateral (see \u00a7 Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral below).\nThe four maltitudes of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side\u2014through the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n\n== Area of a convex quadrilateral ==\nThere are various general formulas for the area K of a convex quadrilateral ABCD with sides a =  AB, b = BC, c = CD and d = DA.\n\n\n=== Trigonometric formulas ===\nThe area can be expressed in trigonometric terms as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              p\n              q\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K={\\frac {pq}{2}}\\sin \\theta ,}\n  where the lengths of the diagonals are p and q and the angle between them is \u03b8.

The intersection of the bimedians is the centroid of the vertices of the quadrilateral.The midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral (convex, concave or crossed) are the vertices of a parallelogram called the Varignon parallelogram. It has the following properties:\n\nEach pair of opposite sides of the Varignon parallelogram are parallel to a diagonal in the original quadrilateral.\nA side of the Varignon parallelogram is half as long as the diagonal in the original quadrilateral it is parallel to.\nThe area of the Varignon parallelogram equals half the area of the original quadrilateral. This is true in convex, concave and crossed quadrilaterals provided the area of the latter is defined to be the difference of the areas of the two triangles it is composed of.\nThe perimeter of the Varignon parallelogram equals the sum of the diagonals of the original quadrilateral.\nThe diagonals of the Varignon parallelogram are the bimedians of the original quadrilateral.The two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are concurrent and are all bisected by their point of intersection.:\u200ap.125\u200aIn a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c and d, the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides a and c is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \u2212\n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              d\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              p\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              q\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\tfrac {1}{2}}{\\sqrt {-a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}+d^{2}+p^{2}+q^{2}}}}\n  where p and q are the length of the diagonals.

Hence that point is the Fermat point of a convex quadrilateral.:\u200ap.120\u200a\n\n\n== Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral ==\nThe centre of a quadrilateral can be defined in several different ways. The \"vertex centroid\" comes from considering the quadrilateral as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The \"side centroid\" comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual centre, called just centroid (centre of area) comes from considering the surface of the quadrilateral as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.The \"vertex centroid\" is the intersection of the two bimedians. As with any polygon, the x and y coordinates of the vertex centroid are the arithmetic means of the x and y coordinates of the vertices.\nThe \"area centroid\" of quadrilateral ABCD can be constructed in the following way. Let Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd be the centroids of triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively. Then the \"area centroid\" is the intersection of the lines GaGc and GbGd.In a general convex quadrilateral ABCD, there are no natural analogies to the circumcenter and orthocenter of a triangle. But two such points can be constructed in the following way. Let Oa, Ob, Oc, Od be the circumcenters of triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively; and denote by Ha, Hb, Hc, Hd the orthocenters in the same triangles. Then the intersection of the lines OaOc and ObOd is called the quasicircumcenter, and the intersection of the lines HaHc and HbHd is called the quasiorthocenter of the convex quadrilateral. These points can be used to define an Euler line of a quadrilateral. In a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter H, the \"area centroid\" G, and the quasicircumcenter O are collinear in this order, and HG = 2GO.There can also be defined a quasinine-point center E as the intersection of the lines EaEc and EbEd, where Ea, Eb, Ec, Ed are the nine-point centers of triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively. Then E is the midpoint of OH.Another remarkable line in a convex non-parallelogram quadrilateral is the Newton line, which connects the midpoints of the diagonals, the segment connecting these points being bisected by the vertex centroid. One more interesting line (in some sense dual to the Newton's one) is the line connecting the point of intersection of diagonals with the vertex centroid. The line is remarkable by the fact that it contains the (area) centroid. The vertex centroid divides the segment connecting the intersection of diagonals and the (area) centroid in the ratio 3:1.For any quadrilateral ABCD with points P and Q the intersections of AD and BC and AB and CD, respectively, the circles (PAB), (PCD), (QAD), and (QBC) pass through a common point M, called a Miquel point.For a convex quadrilateral ABCD in which E is the point of intersection of the diagonals and F is the point of intersection of the extensions of sides BC and AD, let \u03c9 be a circle through E and F which meets CB internally at M and DA internally at N. Let CA meet \u03c9 again at L and let DB meet \u03c9 again at K. Then there holds: the straight lines NK and ML intersect at point P that is located on the side AB; the straight lines NL and KM intersect at point Q that is located on the side CD. \nPoints P and Q are called \"Pascal points\" formed by circle \u03c9 on sides AB and CD.\n\n\n== Other properties of convex quadrilaterals ==\nLet exterior squares be drawn on all sides of a quadrilateral. The segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are (a) equal in length, and (b) perpendicular. Thus these centers are the vertices of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral. This is called Van Aubel's theorem.\nFor any simple quadrilateral with given edge lengths, there is a cyclic quadrilateral with the same edge lengths.\nThe four smaller triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of a convex quadrilateral have the property that the product of the areas of two opposite triangles equals the product of the areas of the other two triangles.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nA hierarchical taxonomy of quadrilaterals is illustrated by the figure to the right. Lower classes are special cases of higher classes they are connected to. Note that \"trapezoid\" here is referring to the North American definition (the British equivalent is a trapezium). Inclusive definitions are used throughout.\n\n\n== Skew quadrilaterals ==\n\nA non-planar quadrilateral is called a skew quadrilateral. Formulas to compute its dihedral angles from the edge lengths and the angle between two adjacent edges were derived for work on the properties of molecules such as cyclobutane that contain a \"puckered\" ring of four atoms. Historically the term gauche quadrilateral was also used to mean a skew quadrilateral. A skew  quadrilateral together with its diagonals form a (possibly non-regular) tetrahedron, and conversely every skew quadrilateral comes from a tetrahedron where a pair of opposite edges is removed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComplete quadrangle\nPerpendicular bisector construction of a quadrilateral\nSaccheri quadrilateral\nTypes of mesh \u00a7 Quadrilateral\nQuadrangle (geography)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Quadrangle, complete\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nQuadrilaterals Formed by Perpendicular Bisectors, Projective Collinearity and  Interactive Classification of Quadrilaterals from cut-the-knot\nDefinitions and examples of quadrilaterals and Definition and properties of tetragons from Mathopenref\nA (dynamic) Hierarchical Quadrilateral Tree at Dynamic Geometry Sketches\nAn extended classification of quadrilaterals Archived 2019-12-30 at the Wayback Machine at Dynamic Math Learning Homepage Archived 2018-08-25 at the Wayback Machine\nThe role and function of a hierarchical classification of quadrilaterals by Michael de Villiers", "Perpendicular": "In elementary geometry, two geometric objects are perpendicular if their intersection forms right angles (angles that are 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians wide) at the point of intersection called a foot. The condition of perpendicularity may be represented graphically using the perpendicular symbol, \u27c2. Perpendicular intersections can happen between two lines (or two line segments), between a line and a plane, and between two planes.\nPerpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of orthogonality; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its normal vector.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nA line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines intersect at a right angle. Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the straight angle on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two congruent angles. Perpendicularity can be shown to be symmetric, meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order. A great example of perpendicularity can be seen in any compass, note the cardinal points; North, East, South, West (NESW)\nThe line N-S is perpendicular to the line W-E and the angles N-E, E-S, S-W and W-N are all 90\u00b0 to one another.\nPerpendicularity easily extends to segments and rays. For example, a line segment \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              B\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overline {AB}}}\n   is perpendicular to a line segment \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              C\n              D\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overline {CD}}}\n   if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above.

This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.\nTwo planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the dihedral angle at which they meet is a right angle.\n\n\n== Foot of a perpendicular ==\nThe word foot is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom.\nMore precisely, let A be a point and m a line. If B is the point of intersection of m and the unique line through A that is perpendicular to m, then B is called the foot of this perpendicular through A.\n\n\n== Construction of the perpendicular ==\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using compass-and-straightedge construction, proceed as follows (see figure left):\n\nStep 1 (red): construct a circle with center at P to create points A' and B' on the line AB, which are equidistant from P.\nStep 2 (green): construct circles centered at A' and B' having equal radius.  Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.\nStep 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.To prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the SSS congruence theorem for QPA' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.  Then use the SAS congruence theorem for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.\nTo make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using Thales's theorem, see the animation at right.\nThe Pythagorean theorem can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side. This method is useful for laying out gardens and fields, where the dimensions are large, and great accuracy is not needed. The chains can be used repeatedly whenever required.\n\n\n== In relationship to parallel lines ==\n\nIf two lines (a and b) are both perpendicular to a third line (c), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles.  Therefore, in Euclidean geometry, any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other, because of the parallel postulate.  Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line.\nIn the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because vertical angles are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent.  Therefore, if lines a and b are parallel, any of the following conclusions leads to all of the others:\n\nOne of the angles in the diagram is a right angle.\nOne of the orange-shaded angles is congruent to one of the green-shaded angles.\nLine c is perpendicular to line a.\nLine c is perpendicular to line b.\n\n\n== In computing distances ==\n\n\n== Graph of functions ==\nIn the two-dimensional plane, right angles can be formed by two intersected lines if the product of their slopes equals  \u22121. Thus defining two linear functions: y1 = a1x + b1 and y2 = a2x + b2, the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular and will make four right angles where the lines intersect if a1a2 = \u22121. However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).\nFor another method, let the two linear functions be: a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 and a2x + b2y + c2 = 0. The lines will be perpendicular if and only if a1a2 + b1b2 = 0. This method is simplified from the dot product (or, more generally, the inner product) of vectors. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\n\n\n== In circles and other conics ==\n\n\n=== Circles ===\nEach diameter of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle.\nA line segment through a circle's center bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.\nIf the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 equals the square of the diameter.The sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8r2 \u2013 4p2 (where r is the circle's radius and p is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).Thales' theorem states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter.\n\n\n=== Ellipses ===\nThe major and minor axes of an ellipse are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse.\nThe major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the directrix and to each latus rectum.\n\n\n=== Parabolas ===\nIn a parabola, the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola.\nFrom a point on the tangent line to a parabola's vertex, the other tangent line to the parabola is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola's focus.\nThe orthoptic property of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.\n\n\n=== Hyperbolas ===\nThe transverse axis of a hyperbola is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.\nThe product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P.\nA rectangular hyperbola has asymptotes that are perpendicular to each other. It has an eccentricity equal to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}.}\n  \n\n\n== In polygons ==\n\n\n=== Triangles ===\nThe legs of a right triangle are perpendicular to each other.\nThe altitudes of a triangle are perpendicular to their respective bases. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.\nThe Euler line of an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the triangle's base.\nThe Droz-Farny line theorem concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle's orthocenter.\nHarcourt's theorem concerns the relationship of line segments through a vertex and perpendicular to any line tangent to the triangle's incircle.\n\n\n=== Quadrilaterals ===\nIn a square or other rectangle, all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A right trapezoid is a trapezoid that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.\nEach of the four maltitudes of a quadrilateral is a perpendicular to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side.\nAn orthodiagonal quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular. These include the square, the rhombus, and the kite. By Brahmagupta's theorem, in an orthodiagonal quadrilateral that is also cyclic, a line through the midpoint of one side and through the intersection point of the diagonals is perpendicular to the opposite side.\nBy van Aubel's theorem, if squares are constructed externally on the sides of a quadrilateral, the line segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are perpendicular and equal in length.\n\n\n== Lines in three dimensions ==\nUp to three lines in three-dimensional space can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the x, y, and z axes of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrthogonal projection\nTangential and normal components\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAltshiller-Court, Nathan (1925), College Geometry: An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle (2nd ed.), New York: Barnes & Noble, LCCN 52-13504\nKay, David C.

The length of a line segment is given by the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. A closed line segment includes both endpoints, while an open line segment excludes both endpoints; a half-open line segment includes exactly one of the endpoints. In geometry, a line segment is often denoted using a line above the symbols for the two endpoints (such as AB).Examples of line segments include the sides of a triangle or square. More generally, when both of the segment's end points are vertices of a polygon or polyhedron, the line segment is either an edge (of that polygon or polyhedron) if they are adjacent vertices, or a diagonal. When the end points both lie on a curve (such as a circle), a line segment is called a chord (of that curve).\n\n\n== In real or complex vector spaces ==\nIf V is a vector space over \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n   or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ,}\n   and L is a subset of V, then L is a line segment if L can be parameterized as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        =\n        {\n        \n          u\n        \n        +\n        t\n        \n          v\n        \n        \u2223\n        t\n        \u2208\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ]\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L=\\{\\mathbf {u} +t\\mathbf {v} \\mid t\\in [0,1]\\}}\n  for some vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          u\n        \n        ,\n        \n          v\n        \n        \u2208\n        V\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} ,\\mathbf {v} \\in V.}\n   In which case, the vectors u and u + v are called the end points of L.\nSometimes, one needs to distinguish between \"open\" and \"closed\" line segments.

However, an open line segment is an open set in V if and only if V is one-dimensional.\nMore generally than above, the concept of a line segment can be defined in an ordered geometry.\nA pair of line segments can be any one of the following: intersecting, parallel, skew, or none of these. The last possibility is a way that line segments differ from lines: if two nonparallel lines are in the same Euclidean plane then they must cross each other, but that need not be true of segments.\n\n\n== In proofs ==\nIn an axiomatic treatment of geometry, the notion of betweenness is either assumed to satisfy a certain number of axioms, or defined in terms of an isometry of a line (used as a coordinate system).\nSegments play an important role in other theories. For example, in a convex set, the segment that joins any two points of the set is contained in the set. This is important because it transforms some of the analysis of convex sets, to the analysis of a line segment. The segment addition postulate can be used to add congruent segment or segments with equal lengths, and consequently substitute other segments into another statement to make segments congruent.\n\n\n== As a degenerate ellipse ==\nA line segment can be viewed as a degenerate case of an ellipse, in which the semiminor axis goes to zero, the foci go to the endpoints, and the eccentricity goes to one. A standard definition of an ellipse is the set of points for which the sum of a point's distances to two foci is a constant; if this constant equals the distance between the foci, the line segment is the result. A complete orbit of this ellipse traverses the line segment twice. As a degenerate orbit, this is a radial elliptic trajectory.\n\n\n== In other geometric shapes ==\nIn addition to appearing as the edges and diagonals of polygons and polyhedra, line segments also appear in numerous other locations relative to other geometric shapes.\n\n\n=== Triangles ===\nSome very frequently considered segments in a triangle to include the three altitudes (each perpendicularly connecting a side or its extension to the opposite vertex), the three medians (each connecting a side's midpoint to the opposite vertex), the perpendicular bisectors of the sides (perpendicularly connecting the midpoint of a side to one of the other sides), and the internal angle bisectors (each connecting a vertex to the opposite side). In each case, there are various equalities relating these segment lengths to others (discussed in the articles on the various types of segment), as well as various inequalities.\nOther segments of interest in a triangle include those connecting various triangle centers to each other, most notably the incenter, the circumcenter, the nine-point center, the centroid and the orthocenter.\n\n\n=== Quadrilaterals ===\nIn addition to the sides and diagonals of a quadrilateral, some important segments are the two bimedians (connecting the midpoints of opposite sides) and the four maltitudes (each perpendicularly connecting one side to the midpoint of the opposite side).\n\n\n=== Circles and ellipses ===\nAny straight line segment connecting  two points on a circle or ellipse is called a chord. Any  chord in a circle which has no longer chord is called a diameter, and any segment connecting the circle's center (the midpoint of a diameter) to a point on the circle is called a radius.\nIn an ellipse, the longest chord, which is also the longest diameter, is called the major axis, and a segment from the midpoint of the major axis (the ellipse's center) to either endpoint of the major axis is called a semi-major axis.  Similarly, the shortest diameter of an ellipse is called the minor axis, and the segment from its midpoint (the ellipse's center) to either of its endpoints is called a semi-minor axis.  The chords of an ellipse which are perpendicular to the major axis and pass through one of its foci are called the latera recta of the ellipse. The interfocal segment connects the two foci.\n\n\n== Directed line segment ==\n\nWhen a line segment is given an orientation (direction) it is called a directed line segment. It suggests a translation or displacement (perhaps caused by a force). The magnitude and direction are indicative of a potential change. Extending a directed line segment semi-infinitely produces a ray and infinitely in both directions produces a directed line. This suggestion has been absorbed into mathematical physics through the concept of a Euclidean vector. The collection of all directed line segments is usually reduced by making \"equivalent\" any pair having the same length and orientation. This application of an equivalence relation dates from Giusto Bellavitis's introduction of the concept of equipollence of directed line segments in 1835.\n\n\n== Generalizations ==\nAnalogous to straight line segments above, one can also define arcs as segments of a curve.\nIn one-dimensional space, a ball is a line segment.\nAn oriented plane segment or bivector generalizes the directed line segment.\n\n\n== Types of line segments ==\nChord (geometry)\nDiameter\nRadius\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolygonal chain\nInterval (mathematics)\nLine segment intersection, the algorithmic problem of finding intersecting pairs in a collection of line segments\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDavid Hilbert The Foundations of Geometry.

The midpoint of a line segment, embedded in a plane, can be located by first constructing a lens using circular arcs of equal (and large enough) radii centered at the two endpoints, then connecting the cusps of the lens (the two points where the arcs intersect). The point where the line connecting the cusps intersects the segment is then the midpoint of the segment. It is more challenging to locate the midpoint using only a compass, but it is still possible according to the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem.\n\n\n== Geometric properties involving midpoints ==\n\n\n=== Circle ===\nThe midpoint of any diameter of a circle is the center of the circle.\nAny line perpendicular to any chord of a circle and passing through its midpoint also passes through the circle's center.\nThe butterfly theorem states that, if M is the midpoint of a chord PQ of a circle, through which two other chords AB and CD are drawn, then AD and BC intersect chord PQ at X and Y respectively, such that M is the midpoint of XY.\n\n\n=== Ellipse ===\nThe midpoint of any segment which is an area bisector or perimeter bisector of an ellipse is the ellipse's center.\nThe ellipse's center is also the midpoint of a segment connecting the two foci of the ellipse.\n\n\n=== Hyperbola ===\nThe midpoint of a segment connecting a hyperbola's vertices is the center of the hyperbola.\n\n\n=== Triangle ===\nThe perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the line that is perpendicular to that side and passes through its midpoint. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle's three sides intersect at the circumcenter (the center of the circle through the three vertices). \nThe median of a triangle's side passes through both the side's midpoint and the triangle's opposite vertex. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the triangle's centroid (the point on which the triangle would balance if it were made of a thin sheet of uniform-density metal).\nThe nine-point center of a triangle lies at the midpoint between the circumcenter and the orthocenter. These points are all on the Euler line.\nA midsegment (or midline) of a triangle is a line segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. It is parallel to the third side and has a length equal to one half of that third side.\nThe medial triangle of a given triangle has vertices at the midpoints of the given triangle's sides, therefore its sides are the three midsegments of the given triangle. It shares the same centroid and medians with the given triangle. The perimeter of the medial triangle equals the semiperimeter (half the perimeter) of the original triangle, and its area is one quarter of the area of the original triangle. The orthocenter (intersection of the altitudes) of the medial triangle coincides with the circumcenter (center of the circle through the vertices) of the original triangle.\nEvery triangle has an inscribed ellipse, called its Steiner inellipse, that is internally tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of all its sides. This ellipse is centered at the triangle's centroid, and it has the largest area of any ellipse inscribed in the triangle.\nIn a right triangle, the circumcenter is the midpoint of the hypotenuse.\nIn an isosceles triangle, the median, altitude, and perpendicular bisector from the base side and the angle bisector of the apex coincide with the Euler line and the axis of symmetry, and these coinciding lines go through the midpoint of the base side.\n\n\n=== Quadrilateral ===\nThe two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent at (all intersect at)a point called the \"vertex centroid\", which is the midpoint of all three of these segments.:\u200ap.125\u200aThe four \"maltitudes\" of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter side. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes all meet at a common point called the \"anticenter\".\nBrahmagupta's theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always goes through the midpoint of the opposite side.\nVarignon's theorem states that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form the vertices of a parallelogram, and if the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting then the area of the parallelogram is half  the area of the quadrilateral.\nThe Newton line is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals in a convex quadrilateral that is not a parallelogram. The line segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral intersect in a point that lies on the Newton line.\n\n\n=== General polygons ===\nA regular polygon has an inscribed circle which is tangent to each side of the polygon at its midpoint.\nIn a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the midpoint of a diagonal between opposite vertices is the polygon's center.\nThe midpoint-stretching polygon of a cyclic polygon P (a polygon whose vertices all fall on the same circle) is another cyclic polygon inscribed in the same circle, the polygon whose vertices are the midpoints of the circular arcs between the vertices of P. Iterating the midpoint-stretching operation on an arbitrary initial polygon results in a sequence of polygons whose shapes converge to that of a regular polygon.\n\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThe abovementioned formulas for the midpoint of a segment implicitly use the lengths of segments. However, in the generalization to affine geometry, where segment lengths are not defined, the midpoint can still be defined since it is an affine invariant. The synthetic affine definition of the midpoint M of a segment AB is the projective harmonic conjugate of the point at infinity, P, of the line AB. That is, the point M such that H[A,B; P,M]. When coordinates can be introduced in an affine geometry, the two definitions of midpoint will coincide.The midpoint is not naturally defined in projective geometry since there is no distinguished point to play the role of the point at infinity (any point in a projective range may be projectively mapped to any other point in (the same or some other) projective range). However, fixing a point at infinity defines an affine structure on the projective line in question and the above definition can be applied. \nThe definition of the midpoint of a segment may be extended to geodesic arcs on a Riemannian manifold. Note that, unlike in the affine case, the midpoint between two points may not be uniquely determined.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCenter (geometry) \u00a7 Projective conics\nMidpoint polygon\nBisection \u00a7 Line segment bisector\nNumerical integration \u00a7 Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnimation \u2013 showing the characteristics of the midpoint of a line segment", "Rectangle": "In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as: an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360\u00b0/4 = 90\u00b0); or a parallelogram containing a right angle. A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a square. The term \"oblong\" is occasionally used to refer to a non-square rectangle. A rectangle with vertices ABCD would be denoted as  ABCD.\nThe word rectangle comes from the Latin rectangulus, which is a combination of rectus (as an adjective, right, proper) and angulus (angle).\nA crossed rectangle is a crossed (self-intersecting) quadrilateral which consists of two opposite sides of a rectangle along with the two diagonals (therefore only two sides are parallel). It is a special case of an antiparallelogram, and its angles are not right angles and not all equal, though opposite angles are equal. Other geometries, such as spherical, elliptic, and hyperbolic, have so-called rectangles with opposite sides equal in length and equal angles that are not right angles.\nRectangles are involved in many tiling problems, such as tiling the plane by rectangles or tiling a rectangle by polygons.\n\n\n== Characterizations ==\nA convex quadrilateral is a rectangle if and only if it is any one of the following:\na parallelogram with at least one right angle\na parallelogram with diagonals of equal length\na parallelogram ABCD where triangles ABD and DCA are congruent\nan equiangular quadrilateral\na quadrilateral with four right angles\na quadrilateral where the two diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other\na convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        a\n        +\n        c\n        )\n        (\n        b\n        +\n        d\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{4}}(a+c)(b+d)}\n  .:\u200afn.1\u200a\na convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n            (\n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              d\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}{\\sqrt {(a^{2}+c^{2})(b^{2}+d^{2})}}.}\n  \n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Traditional hierarchy ===\nA rectangle is a special case of a parallelogram in which each pair of adjacent sides is perpendicular.\nA parallelogram is a special case of a trapezium (known as a trapezoid in North America) in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.\nA trapezium is a convex quadrilateral which has at least one pair of parallel opposite sides.\nA convex quadrilateral is\n\nSimple: The boundary does not cross itself.\nStar-shaped: The whole interior is visible from a single point, without crossing any edge.\n\n\n=== Alternative hierarchy ===\nDe Villiers defines a rectangle more generally as any quadrilateral with axes of symmetry through each pair of opposite sides.  This definition includes both right-angled rectangles and crossed rectangles. Each has an axis of symmetry parallel to and equidistant from a pair of opposite sides, and another which is the perpendicular bisector of those sides, but, in the case of the crossed rectangle, the first axis is not an axis of symmetry for either side that it bisects.\nQuadrilaterals with two axes of symmetry, each through a pair of opposite sides, belong to the larger class of quadrilaterals with at least one axis of symmetry through a pair of opposite sides. These quadrilaterals comprise isosceles trapezia and crossed isosceles trapezia (crossed quadrilaterals with the same vertex arrangement as isosceles trapezia).\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Symmetry ===\nA rectangle is cyclic: all corners lie on a single circle.\nIt is equiangular: all its corner angles are equal (each of 90 degrees).\nIt is isogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit.\nIt has two lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180\u00b0).\n\n\n=== Rectangle-rhombus duality ===\nThe dual polygon of a rectangle is a rhombus, as shown in the table below.\nThe figure formed by joining, in order, the midpoints of the sides of a rectangle is a rhombus and vice versa.\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nA rectangle is a rectilinear polygon: its sides meet at right angles.\nA rectangle in the plane can be defined by five independent degrees of freedom consisting, for example, of three for position (comprising two of translation and one of rotation), one for shape (aspect ratio), and one for overall size (area).\nTwo rectangles, neither of which will fit inside the other, are said to be incomparable.\n\n\n== Formulae ==\n\nIf a rectangle has length \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2113\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n   and width \n  \n    \n      \n        w\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w}\n  \n\nit has area \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \u2113\n        w\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=\\ell w\\,}\n  ,\nit has perimeter \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        2\n        \u2113\n        +\n        2\n        w\n        =\n        2\n        (\n        \u2113\n        +\n        w\n        )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P=2\\ell +2w=2(\\ell +w)\\,}\n  ,\neach diagonal has length \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2113\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              w\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d={\\sqrt {\\ell ^{2}+w^{2}}}}\n  ,\nand when \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2113\n        =\n        w\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell =w\\,}\n  , the rectangle is a square.\n\n\n== Theorems ==\nThe isoperimetric theorem for rectangles states that among all rectangles of a given perimeter, the square has the largest area.\nThe midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals form a rectangle.\nA parallelogram with equal diagonals is a rectangle.\nThe Japanese theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals states that the incentres of the four triangles determined by the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral taken three at a time form a rectangle.\nThe British flag theorem states that with vertices denoted A, B, C, and D, for any point P on the same plane of a rectangle:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          A\n          P\n          \n            )\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          +\n          (\n          C\n          P\n          \n            )\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          =\n          (\n          B\n          P\n          \n            )\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          +\n          (\n          D\n          P\n          \n            )\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\displaystyle (AP)^{2}+(CP)^{2}=(BP)^{2}+(DP)^{2}.}\n  For every convex body C in the plane, we can inscribe a rectangle r in C such that a homothetic copy R of r is circumscribed about C and the positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and \n  \n    \n      \n        0.5\n        \n           \u00d7 Area\n        \n        (\n        R\n        )\n        \u2264\n        \n          Area\n        \n        (\n        C\n        )\n        \u2264\n        2\n        \n           \u00d7 Area\n        \n        (\n        r\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0.5{\\text{ \u00d7 Area}}(R)\\leq {\\text{Area}}(C)\\leq 2{\\text{ \u00d7 Area}}(r)}\n  .\n\n\n== Crossed rectangles ==\nA crossed quadrilateral (self-intersecting) consists of two opposite sides of a non-self-intersecting quadrilateral along with the two diagonals. Similarly, a crossed rectangle is a crossed quadrilateral which consists of two opposite sides of a rectangle along with the two diagonals. It has the same vertex arrangement as the rectangle. It appears as two identical triangles with a common vertex, but the geometric intersection is not considered a vertex.\nA crossed quadrilateral is sometimes likened to a bow tie or butterfly, sometimes called an \"angular eight\". A three-dimensional rectangular wire frame that is twisted can take the shape of a bow tie.\nThe interior of a crossed rectangle can have a polygon density of \u00b11 in each triangle, dependent upon the winding orientation as clockwise or counterclockwise.\nA crossed rectangle may be considered equiangular if right and left turns are allowed. As with any crossed quadrilateral, the sum of its interior angles is 720\u00b0, allowing for internal angles to appear on the outside and exceed 180\u00b0.A rectangle and a crossed rectangle are quadrilaterals with the following properties in common:\n\nOpposite sides are equal in length.\nThe two diagonals are equal in length.\nIt has two lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180\u00b0).\n\n\n== Other rectangles ==\n\nIn spherical geometry, a spherical rectangle is a figure whose four edges are great circle arcs which meet at equal angles greater than 90\u00b0. Opposite arcs are equal in length. The surface of a sphere in Euclidean solid geometry is a non-Euclidean surface in the sense of elliptic geometry. Spherical geometry is the simplest form of elliptic geometry.\nIn elliptic geometry, an elliptic rectangle is a figure in the elliptic plane whose four edges are elliptic arcs which meet at equal angles greater than 90\u00b0. Opposite arcs are equal in length.\nIn hyperbolic geometry, a hyperbolic rectangle is a figure in the hyperbolic plane whose four edges are hyperbolic arcs which meet at equal angles less than 90\u00b0. Opposite arcs are equal in length.\n\n\n== Tessellations ==\nThe rectangle is used in many periodic tessellation patterns, in brickwork, for example, these tilings:\n\n\n== Squared, perfect, and other tiled rectangles ==\n\nA rectangle tiled by squares, rectangles, or triangles is said to be a \"squared\", \"rectangled\", or \"triangulated\" (or \"triangled\") rectangle respectively. The tiled rectangle is perfect if the tiles are similar and finite in number and no two tiles are the same size. If two such tiles are the same size, the tiling is imperfect. In a perfect (or imperfect) triangled rectangle the triangles must be right triangles. A database of all known perfect rectangles, perfect squares and related shapes can be found at squaring.net. The lowest number of squares need for a perfect tiling of a rectangle is 9 and the lowest number needed for a perfect tilling a square is 21, found in 1978 by computer search.A rectangle has commensurable sides if and only if it is tileable by a finite number of unequal squares. The same is true if the tiles are unequal isosceles right triangles.\nThe tilings of rectangles by other tiles which have attracted the most attention are those by congruent non-rectangular polyominoes, allowing all rotations and reflections. There are also tilings by congruent polyaboloes.\n\n\n== Unicode ==\n   U+25AC \u25ac BLACK RECTANGLE\n   U+25AD \u25ad WHITE RECTANGLE\n   U+25AE \u25ae BLACK VERTICAL RECTANGLE\n   U+25AF \u25af WHITE VERTICAL RECTANGLE\n\n\n== See also ==\nCuboid\nGolden rectangle\nHyperrectangle\nSuperellipse (includes a rectangle with rounded corners)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Rectangle\".

As a consequence of this definition, the point where two lines meet to form an angle and the corners of polygons and polyhedra are vertices.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\n\n=== Of an angle ===\n\nThe vertex of an angle is the point where two rays begin or meet, where two line segments join or meet, where two lines intersect (cross), or any appropriate combination of rays, segments, and lines that result in two straight \"sides\" meeting at one place.\n\n\n=== Of a polytope ===\nA vertex is a corner point of a polygon, polyhedron, or other higher-dimensional polytope, formed by the intersection of edges, faces or facets of the object.In a polygon, a vertex is called \"convex\" if the internal angle of the polygon (i.e., the angle formed by the two edges at the vertex with the polygon inside the angle) is less than \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0, two right angles); otherwise, it is called \"concave\" or \"reflex\". More generally, a vertex of a polyhedron or polytope is convex, if the intersection of the polyhedron or polytope with a sufficiently small sphere centered at the vertex is convex, and is concave otherwise.Polytope vertices are related to vertices of graphs, in that the 1-skeleton of a polytope is a graph, the vertices of which correspond to the vertices of the polytope, and in that a graph can be viewed as a 1-dimensional simplicial complex the vertices of which are the graph's vertices.However, in graph theory, vertices may have fewer than two incident edges, which is usually not allowed for geometric vertices. There is also a connection between geometric vertices and the vertices of a curve, its points of extreme curvature: in some sense the vertices of a polygon are points of infinite curvature, and if a polygon is approximated by a smooth curve, there will be a point of extreme curvature near each polygon vertex. However, a smooth curve approximation to a polygon will also have additional vertices, at the points where its curvature is minimal.\n\n\n=== Of a plane tiling ===\nA vertex of a plane tiling or tessellation is a point where three or more tiles meet; generally, but not always, the tiles of a tessellation are polygons and the vertices of the tessellation are also vertices of its tiles. More generally, a tessellation can be viewed as a kind of topological cell complex, as can the faces of a polyhedron or polytope; the vertices of other kinds of complexes such as simplicial complexes are its zero-dimensional faces.\n\n\n== Principal vertex ==\n\nA polygon vertex xi of a simple polygon P is a principal polygon vertex if the diagonal [x(i \u2212 1), x(i + 1)] intersects the boundary of P only at x(i \u2212 1) and x(i + 1). There are two types of principal vertices: ears and mouths.\n\n\n=== Ears ===\nA principal vertex xi of a simple polygon P is called an ear if the diagonal [x(i \u2212 1), x(i + 1)] that bridges xi lies entirely in P. (see also convex polygon) According to the two ears theorem, every simple polygon has at least two ears.\n\n\n=== Mouths ===\nA principal vertex xi of a simple polygon P is called a mouth if the diagonal [x(i \u2212 1), x(i + 1)] lies outside the boundary of P.\n\n\n== Number of vertices of a polyhedron ==\nAny convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        \u2212\n        E\n        +\n        F\n        =\n        2\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V-E+F=2,}\n  where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula. Thus the number of vertices is 2 more than the excess of the number of edges over the number of faces. For example, since a cube has 12 edges and 6 faces, the formula implies that it has eight vertices.\n\n\n== Vertices in computer graphics ==\n\nIn computer graphics, objects are often represented as triangulated polyhedra in which the object vertices are associated not only with three spatial coordinates but also with other graphical information necessary to render the object correctly, such as colors, reflectance properties, textures, and surface normal. These properties are used in rendering by a vertex shader, part of the vertex pipeline.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVertex arrangement\nVertex figure\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Polygon Vertex\".

MathWorld.", "Rotational_symmetry": "Rotational symmetry, also known as radial symmetry in geometry, is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object's degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks exactly the same for each rotation.\nCertain geometric objects are partially symmetrical when rotated at certain angles such as squares rotated 90\u00b0, however the only geometric objects that are fully rotationally symmetric at any angle are spheres, circles and other spheroids.\n\n\n== Formal treatment ==\n \nFormally the  rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in m-dimensional Euclidean space. Rotations are direct isometries, i.e., isometries preserving orientation. Therefore, a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of E +(m) (see Euclidean group).\nSymmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations, so space is homogeneous, and the symmetry group is the whole E(m). With the modified notion of symmetry for vector fields the symmetry group can also be E +(m).\nFor symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin. These rotations form the special orthogonal group SO(m), the group of m \u00d7 m orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. For m = 3 this is the rotation group SO(3).\nIn another definition of the word, the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within E +(n), the group of direct isometries ; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.\nLaws of physics are SO(3)-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space. Because of Noether's theorem, the rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law.\n\n\n=== Discrete rotational symmetry ===\nRotational symmetry of order n, also called n-fold rotational symmetry, or discrete rotational symmetry of the nth order, with respect to a particular point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D) means that rotation by an angle of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                360\n                \n                  \u2218\n                \n              \n              n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {360^{\\circ }}{n}}}\n   (180\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 51 3\u20447\u00b0, etc.) does not change the object. A  \"1-fold\" symmetry is no symmetry (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360\u00b0).\nThe notation for n-fold symmetry is Cn or simply n. The actual symmetry group is specified by the point or axis of symmetry, together with the n. For each point or axis of symmetry, the abstract group type is cyclic group of order n, Zn. Although for the latter also the notation Cn is used, the geometric and abstract Cn should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different, see cyclic symmetry groups in 3D.\nThe fundamental domain is a sector of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                360\n                \n                  \u2218\n                \n              \n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {360^{\\circ }}{n}}.}\n  \nExamples without additional reflection symmetry:\n\nn = 2, 180\u00b0: the dyad; letters Z, N, S; the outlines, albeit not the colors, of the yin and yang symbol; the Union Flag (as divided along the flag's diagonal and rotated about the flag's center point)\nn = 3, 120\u00b0: triad, triskelion, Borromean rings; sometimes the term trilateral symmetry is used;\nn = 4, 90\u00b0: tetrad, swastika\nn = 6, 60\u00b0: hexad, Star of David (this one has additional reflection symmetry)\nn = 8, 45\u00b0: octad, Octagonal muqarnas, computer-generated (CG), ceilingCn is the rotation group of a regular n-sided polygon in 2D and of a regular n-sided pyramid in 3D.\nIf there is e.g. rotational symmetry with respect to an angle of 100\u00b0, then also with respect to one of 20\u00b0, the greatest common divisor of 100\u00b0 and 360\u00b0.\nA typical 3D object with rotational symmetry (possibly also with perpendicular axes) but no mirror symmetry is a propeller.\n\n\n=== Examples ===\n\n\n=== Multiple symmetry axes through the same point ===\nFor discrete symmetry with multiple symmetry axes through the same point, there are the following possibilities:\n\nIn addition to an n-fold axis, n perpendicular 2-fold axes: the dihedral groups Dn of order 2n (n \u2265 2). This is the rotation group of a regular prism, or regular bipyramid.

The group is isomorphic to alternating group A4.\n3\u00d74-fold, 4\u00d73-fold, and 6\u00d72-fold axes: the rotation group O of order 24 of a cube and a regular octahedron.

The group is isomorphic to alternating group A5. The group contains 10 versions of D3 and 6 versions of D5 (rotational symmetries like prisms and antiprisms).In the case of the Platonic solids, the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges, and the number of them is half the number of edges. The other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces, except in the case of the tetrahedron, where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face.\n\n\n=== Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle ===\nRotational symmetry with respect to any angle is, in two dimensions, circular symmetry. The fundamental domain is a half-line.\nIn three dimensions we can distinguish cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry (no change when rotating about one axis, or for any rotation). That is, no dependence on the angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates. The fundamental domain is a half-plane through the axis, and a radial half-line, respectively. Axisymmetric or axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry, or axisymmetry (i.e. rotational symmetry with respect to a central axis) like a doughnut (torus). An example of approximate spherical symmetry is the Earth (with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties).\nIn 4D, continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2D rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane, about the point of intersection. An object can also have  rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes, e.g. if it is the Cartesian product of two rotationally symmetry 2D figures, as in the case of e.g. the duocylinder and various regular duoprisms.\n\n\n=== Rotational symmetry with translational symmetry ===\n2-fold rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the Frieze groups. There are two rotocenters per primitive cell.\nTogether with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the  following wallpaper groups, with axes per primitive cell:\n\np2 (2222): 4\u00d72-fold; rotation group of a parallelogrammic, rectangular, and rhombic lattice.\np3 (333): 3\u00d73-fold; not the rotation group of any lattice (every lattice is upside-down the same, but that does not apply for this symmetry); it is e.g. the rotation group of the regular triangular tiling with the  equilateral triangles alternatingly colored.\np4 (442): 2\u00d74-fold, 2\u00d72-fold; rotation group of a square lattice.\np6 (632): 1\u00d76-fold, 2\u00d73-fold, 3\u00d72-fold; rotation group of a hexagonal lattice.\n2-fold rotocenters (including possible 4-fold and 6-fold), if present at all, form the translate of a lattice equal to the translational lattice, scaled by a factor 1/2. In the case translational symmetry in one dimension, a similar property applies, though the term \"lattice\" does not apply.\n3-fold rotocenters (including possible 6-fold), if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 30\u00b0 (or equivalently 90\u00b0), and scaled by a factor \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              3\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{3}}{\\sqrt {3}}}\n  \n4-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular square lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 45\u00b0, and scaled by a factor \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}{\\sqrt {2}}}\n  \n6-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice which is the translate of the translational lattice.Scaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor. Therefore, the number of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold, etc.\n3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one (or ditto in 3D with respect to parallel axes) implies rotation group p6, i.e. double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point (or, in 3D, parallel axis).

Any pair of (possibly unalike) objects with well-defined centers can be concentric, including circles, spheres, regular polygons, regular polyhedra, parallelograms, cones, conic sections, and quadrics.Geometric objects are coaxial  if they share the same axis (line of symmetry). Geometric objects with a well-defined axis include circles (any line through the center), spheres, cylinders, conic sections, and surfaces of revolution.\nConcentric objects are often part of the broad category of whorled patterns, which also includes spirals (a curve which emanates from a point, moving farther away as it revolves around the point).\n\n\n== Geometric properties ==\nIn the Euclidean plane, two circles that are concentric necessarily have different radii from each other.\nHowever, circles in three-dimensional space may be concentric, and have the same radius as each other, but nevertheless be different circles. For example, two different meridians of a terrestrial globe are concentric with each other and with the globe of the earth (approximated as a sphere). More generally, every two great circles on a sphere are concentric with each other and with the sphere.By Euler's theorem in geometry on the distance between the circumcenter and incenter of a triangle, two concentric circles (with that distance being zero) are the circumcircle and incircle of a triangle if and only if the radius of one is twice the radius of the other, in which case the triangle is equilateral.:\u200ap. 198\u200aThe circumcircle and the incircle of a regular n-gon, and the regular n-gon itself, are concentric. For the circumradius-to-inradius ratio for various n, see Bicentric polygon#Regular polygons. The same can be said of a regular polyhedron's insphere, midsphere and circumsphere.\nThe region of the plane between two concentric circles is an annulus, and analogously the region of space between two concentric spheres is a spherical shell.For a given point c in the plane, the set of all circles having c as their center forms a pencil of circles. Each two circles in the pencil are concentric, and have different radii. Every point in the plane, except for the shared center, belongs to exactly one of the circles in the pencil. Every two disjoint circles, and every hyperbolic pencil of circles, may be transformed into a set of concentric circles by a M\u00f6bius transformation.\n\n\n== Applications and examples ==\nThe ripples formed by dropping a small object into still water naturally form an expanding system of concentric circles. Evenly spaced circles on the targets used in target archery or similar sports provide another familiar example of concentric circles.\nCoaxial cable is a type of electrical cable in which the combined neutral and earth core completely surrounds the live core(s) in system of concentric cylindrical shells.Johannes Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum envisioned a cosmological system formed by concentric regular polyhedra and spheres.Concentric circles are also found in diopter sights, a type of mechanic sights commonly found on target rifles. They usually feature a large disk with a small-diameter hole near the shooter's eye, and a front globe sight (a circle contained inside another circle, called tunnel). When these sights are correctly aligned, the point of impact will be in the middle of the front sight circle.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCentered cube number\nHomoeoid\nFocaloid\nCircular symmetry\nMagic circle (mathematics)\nSpiral\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeometry: Concentric circles demonstration With interactive animation", "Circle": "A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. Equivalently, it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number. A circle with \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r=0}\n   (a single point) is a degenerate case. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\nSpecifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc.\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident, the eccentricity is 0, and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations.\n\n\n== Euclid's definition ==\nA circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal. The bounding line is called its circumference and the point, its centre.\n\n\n== Topological definition ==\nIn the field of topology, a circle is not limited to the geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms. Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy).\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nAnnulus: a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two concentric circles.\nArc: any connected part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a centre allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.\nCentre: the point equidistant from all points on the circle.\nChord: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments.\nCircumference: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.\nDiameter: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.\nDisc: the region of the plane bounded by a circle.\nLens: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.\nPassant: a coplanar straight line that has no point in common with the circle.\nRadius: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter.\nSector: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common centre and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this centre and the endpoints of the radii.\nSegment: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term segment is used only for regions not containing the centre of the circle to which their arc belongs to.\nSecant: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.\nSemicircle: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as centre. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the  two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-disc. A half-disc is a special case of a segment, namely the largest one.\nTangent: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\"touches the circle at this point\").All of the specified regions may be considered as open, that is, not containing their boundaries, or as closed, including their respective boundaries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word circle derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03af\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2/\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (kirkos/kuklos), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (krikos), meaning \"hoop\" or \"ring\". The origins of the words circus and circuit are closely related.\n\n \nThe circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.\nEarly science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically \"divine\" or \"perfect\" that could be found in circles.Some highlights in the history of the circle are:\n\n1700 BCE \u2013 The Rhind papyrus gives a method to find the area of a circular field. The result corresponds to 256/81 (3.16049...) as an approximate value of \u03c0.\n300 BCE \u2013 Book 3 of Euclid's Elements deals with the properties of circles.\nIn Plato's Seventh Letter there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle. Plato explains the perfect circle, and how it is different from any drawing, words, definition or explanation.\n1880 CE \u2013 Lindemann proves that \u03c0 is transcendental, effectively settling the millennia-old problem of squaring the circle.\n\n\n== Analytic results ==\n\n\n=== Circumference ===\n\nThe ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is \u03c0 (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the circumference C is related to the radius r and diameter d by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        2\n        \u03c0\n        r\n        =\n        \u03c0\n        d\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C=2\\pi r=\\pi d.\\,}\n  \n\n\n=== Area enclosed ===\n\nAs proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, which comes to \u03c0 multiplied by the radius squared:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          r\n          e\n          a\n        \n        =\n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Area} =\\pi r^{2}.\\,}\n  Equivalently, denoting diameter by d,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          r\n          e\n          a\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n              \n                d\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            4\n          \n        \n        \u2248\n        0\n        \n          .\n        \n        7854\n        \n          d\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Area} ={\\frac {\\pi d^{2}}{4}}\\approx 0{.}7854d^{2},}\n  that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d).\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.\n\n\n=== Equations ===\n\n\n==== Cartesian coordinates ====\n\nEquation of a circleIn an x\u2013y Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (a, b) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y) such that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        a\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        (\n        y\n        \u2212\n        b\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}.}\n  This equation, known as the equation of the circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |x \u2212 a| and |y \u2212 b|.

If P = (x1, y1) and the circle has centre (a, b) and radius r, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (a, b) to (x1, y1), so it has the form (x1 \u2212 a)x + (y1 \u2013 b)y = c.

Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,R). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T.\nAll circles are similar.\nA circle circumference and radius are proportional.\nThe area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.\nThe constants of proportionality are 2\u03c0 and \u03c0 respectively.\nThe circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.\nThought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.\nThrough any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See circumcircle.\n\n\n=== Chord ===\nChords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\nThe perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\nA perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\nThe line segment through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.\nIf a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\nIf two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\nIf two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplementary.\nFor a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.\nAn inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see Thales' theorem).\nThe diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\nAmong all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\nIf the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then ab = cd.\nIf the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 equals the square of the diameter.\nThe sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point and is given by 8r2 \u2212 4p2, where r is the circle radius, and p is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection.\nThe distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.:\u200ap.71\u200a\n\n\n=== Tangent ===\nA line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\nA line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\nTwo tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\nIf a tangent at A and a tangent at B intersect at the exterior point P, then denoting the centre as O, the angles \u2220BOA and \u2220BPA are supplementary.\nIf AD is tangent to the circle at A and if AQ is a chord of the circle, then \u2220DAQ = 1/2arc(AQ).\n\n\n=== Theorems ===\n\nThe chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EB, intersect at A, then AC \u00d7 AD = AB \u00d7 AE.\nIf two secants, AE and AD, also cut the circle at B and C respectively, then AC \u00d7 AD = AB \u00d7 AE (corollary of the chord theorem).\nA tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a tangent from an external point A meets the circle at F and a secant from the external point A meets the circle at C and D respectively, then AF2 = AC \u00d7 AD (tangent\u2013secant theorem).\nThe angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (tangent chord angle).\nIf the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90\u00b0, then \u2113 = r \u221a2, where \u2113 is the length of the chord, and r is the radius of the circle.\nIf two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              D\n              E\n            \n            \u2322\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overset {\\frown }{DE}}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              B\n              C\n            \n            \u2322\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overset {\\frown }{BC}}}\n  ).

Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180\u00b0).\n\n\n=== Sagitta ===\n\nThe sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\nGiven the length y of a chord and the length x of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              y\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              8\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            x\n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r={\\frac {y^{2}}{8x}}+{\\frac {x}{2}}.}\n  Another proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know that it is a part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is (2r \u2212 x) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2r \u2212 x)x = (y / 2)2. Solving for r, we find the required result.\n\n\n== Compass and straightedge constructions ==\nThere are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n\n=== Construction with given diameter ===\nConstruct the midpoint M of the diameter.\nConstruct the circle with centre M passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\n\n=== Construction through three noncollinear points ===\nName the points P, Q and R,\nConstruct the perpendicular bisector of the segment PQ.\nConstruct the perpendicular bisector of the segment PR.\nLabel the point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors M. (They meet because the points are not collinear).\nConstruct the circle with centre M passing through one of the points P, Q or R (it will also pass through the other two points).\n\n\n== Circle of Apollonius ==\n\nApollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant ratio (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, A and B. (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points.\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci A and B and a ratio of distances, any point P satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let C be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment AB. By the angle bisector theorem the line segment PC will bisect the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              P\n            \n            \n              B\n              P\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              C\n            \n            \n              B\n              C\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {AP}{BP}}={\\frac {AC}{BC}}.}\n  Analogously, a line segment PD through some point D on AB extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle BPQ where Q is on AP extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees; that is, a right angle. The set of points P such that angle CPD is a right angle forms a circle, of which CD is a diameter.\nSecond, see:\u200ap.15\u200a for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n\n=== Cross-ratios ===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If A, B, and C are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points P for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            |\n          \n        \n        [\n        A\n        ,\n        B\n        ;\n        C\n        ,\n        P\n        ]\n        \n          \n            |\n          \n        \n        =\n        1.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\big |}[A,B;C,P]{\\big |}=1.}\n  Stated another way, P is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [A, B; C, P] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n\n=== Generalised circles ===\n\nIf C is the midpoint of the segment AB, then the collection of points P satisfying the Apollonius condition\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              A\n              P\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              B\n              P\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              A\n              C\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              B\n              C\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {|AP|}{|BP|}}={\\frac {|AC|}{|BC|}}}\n   is not a circle, but rather a line.\nThus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n\n== Inscription in or circumscription about other figures ==\nIn every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.About every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices.A tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\nA cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.\nA hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n\n== Limiting case of other figures ==\nThe circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:\n\nA Cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\nA superellipse has an equation of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            |\n            \n              \n                x\n                a\n              \n            \n            |\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            |\n            \n              \n                y\n                b\n              \n            \n            |\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left|{\\frac {x}{a}}\\right|^{n}\\!+\\left|{\\frac {y}{b}}\\right|^{n}\\!=1}\n   for positive a, b, and n. A supercircle has b = a. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which n = 2.\nA Cassini oval is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\nA curve of constant width is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n\n== In other p-norms ==\n\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance.

For the regular pentagon the constant sum of the eighth powers of the distances will be added and so forth.\n\n\n== Squaring the circle ==\n\nSquaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi (\u03c0) is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. Despite the impossibility, this topic continues to be of interest for pseudomath enthusiasts.\n\n\n== Significance in art and symbolism ==\n\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist's message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle's perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPedoe, Dan (1988).

It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. This theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and the hypotenuse c, often called the Pythagorean equation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.}\n  The theorem is named for the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC.  The theorem has been proven numerous times by many different methods \u2013 possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. The proofs are diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years.\nWhen Euclidean space is represented by a Cartesian coordinate system in analytic geometry, Euclidean distance satisfies the Pythagorean relation: the squared distance between two points equals the sum of squares of the difference in each coordinate between the points.\nThe theorem can be generalized in various ways: to higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and to objects that are not triangles at all but n-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps, and cartoons abound.\n\n\n== Proofs using constructed squares ==\n\n\n=== Rearrangement proofs ===\nIn one rearrangement proof, two squares are used whose sides have a measure of  \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        +\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a+b}\n    and which contain four right triangles whose sides are a, b and c, with the hypotenuse being c.

Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion \"that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him.\"  Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues.\n\n\n=== Algebraic proofs ===\n\nThe theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side c, as shown in the lower part of the diagram.

Draw the altitude from point C, and call H its intersection with the side AB. Point H divides the length of the hypotenuse c into parts d and e. The new triangle, ACH, is similar to triangle ABC, because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at A, meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as \u03b8 in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle CBH is also similar to ABC. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the triangle postulate: The sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the parallel postulate. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              B\n              C\n            \n            \n              A\n              B\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              B\n              H\n            \n            \n              B\n              C\n            \n          \n        \n        \n           and \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              C\n            \n            \n              A\n              B\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              H\n            \n            \n              A\n              C\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {BC}{AB}}={\\frac {BH}{BC}}{\\text{ and }}{\\frac {AC}{AB}}={\\frac {AH}{AC}}.}\n  The first result equates the cosines of the angles \u03b8, whereas the second result equates their sines.\nThese ratios can be written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        A\n        B\n        \u00d7\n        B\n        H\n        \n           and \n        \n        A\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        A\n        B\n        \u00d7\n        A\n        H\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle BC^{2}=AB\\times BH{\\text{ and }}AC^{2}=AB\\times AH.}\n  Summing these two equalities results in\n\n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        A\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        A\n        B\n        \u00d7\n        B\n        H\n        +\n        A\n        B\n        \u00d7\n        A\n        H\n        =\n        A\n        B\n        (\n        A\n        H\n        +\n        B\n        H\n        )\n        =\n        A\n        \n          B\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB\\times BH+AB\\times AH=AB(AH+BH)=AB^{2},}\n  which, after simplification, demonstrates the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        A\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        A\n        \n          B\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB^{2}.}\n  The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the Elements, and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.\n\n\n=== Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement ===\nAlbert Einstein gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces do not need to be moved. Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two similar shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see Similar figures on the three sides).  In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.  Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle.  Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.\n\n\n=== Trigonometric proof using Einstein's construction ===\n\nBoth the proof using similar triangles and Einstein's proof rely on constructing the height to the hypotenuse of the right triangle \n  \n    \n      \n        \u25b3\n        A\n        B\n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\triangle ABC}\n  .

The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be congruent, proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.\nLet A, B, C be the vertices of a right triangle, with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.\nFor the formal proof, we require four elementary lemmata:\n\nIf two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent (side-angle-side).\nThe area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.\nThe area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.\nThe area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.\n\nThe proof is as follows:\n\nLet ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.\nOn each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.\nFrom A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.\nJoin CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.\nAngles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are collinear.\nAngles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.\nSince AB is equal to FB, BD is equal to BC and angle ABD equals angle FBC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC.\nSince A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2)\nSince C is collinear with A and G, and this line is parallel to FB, then square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC.\nTherefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB2.\nBy applying steps 3 to 10 to the other side of the figure, it can be similarly shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC2.\nAdding these two results, AB2 + AC2 = BD \u00d7 BK + KL \u00d7 KC\nSince BD = KL, BD \u00d7 BK + KL \u00d7 KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD \u00d7 BC\nTherefore, AB2 + AC2 = BC2, since CBDE is a square.This proof, which appears in Euclid's Elements as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1, demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares.\nThis is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used.\n\n\n=== Proofs by dissection and rearrangement ===\nAnother by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area c2, from four identical right triangles with sides a, b and c, fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2, which must have the same area as the initial large square.The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse \u2013 or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called dissection. This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones.\n\n\n=== Proof by area-preserving shearing ===\n\nAs shown in the accompanying animation, area-preserving shear mappings and translations can transform the squares on the sides adjacent to the right-angle onto the square on the hypotenuse, together covering it exactly. Each shear leaves the base and height unchanged, thus leaving the area unchanged too. The translations also leave the area unchanged, as they do not alter the shapes at all. Each square is first sheared into a parallelogram, and then into a rectangle which can be translated onto one section of the square on the hypotenuse.\n\n\n=== Other algebraic proofs ===\nA related proof was published by future U.S. President James A. Garfield (then a U.S. Representative) (see diagram). Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid, which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square, to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram. The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        b\n        +\n        a\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}(b+a)^{2}.}\n  The inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}}\n  , which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result.\n\n\n=== Proof using differentials ===\nOne can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing calculus.The triangle ABC is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with BC the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length y, the side AC of length x and the side AB of length a, as seen in the lower diagram part.\n\nIf x is increased by a small amount dx by extending the side AC slightly to D, then y also increases by dy. These form two sides of a triangle, CDE, which (with E chosen so CE is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to ABC. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            x\n            y\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}={\\frac {x}{y}}.}\n  This can be rewritten as \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        \n        d\n        y\n        =\n        x\n        \n        d\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y\\,dy=x\\,dx}\n   , which is a differential equation that can be solved by direct integration:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u222b\n        y\n        \n        d\n        y\n        =\n        \u222b\n        x\n        \n        d\n        x\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int y\\,dy=\\int x\\,dx\\,,}\n  giving\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        C\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+C.}\n  The constant can be deduced from x = 0, y = a to give the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+a^{2}.}\n  This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of dx and dy.\n\n\n== Converse ==\nThe converse of the theorem is also true:\nGiven a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, if a2 + b2 = c2, then the angle between sides a and b is a right angle.\nFor any three positive real numbers a, b, and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle with sides a, b and c as a consequence of the converse of the triangle inequality.\nThis converse appears in Euclid's Elements (Book I, Proposition 48):  \"If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.\"It can be proven using the law of cosines or as follows:\nLet ABC be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, with a2 + b2 = c2. Construct a second triangle with sides of length a and b containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length c = \u221aa2 + b2, the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths a, b and c, the triangles are congruent and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths a and b in the original triangle is a right angle.\nThe above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proven without assuming the Pythagorean theorem.A corollary of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let c be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and a + b > c (otherwise there is no triangle according to the triangle inequality). The following statements apply:\nIf a2 + b2 = c2, then the triangle is right.\nIf a2 + b2 > c2, then the triangle is acute.\nIf a2 + b2 < c2, then the triangle is obtuse.Edsger W. Dijkstra has stated this proposition about acute, right, and obtuse triangles in this language:\n\nsgn(\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3) = sgn(a2 + b2 \u2212 c2),where \u03b1 is the angle opposite to side a, \u03b2 is the angle opposite to side b, \u03b3 is the angle opposite to side c, and sgn is the sign function.\n\n\n== Consequences and uses of the theorem ==\n\n\n=== Pythagorean triples ===\n\nA Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a2 + b2 = c2. In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c). Some well-known examples are (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13).\nA primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime (the greatest common divisor of a, b and c is 1).\nThe following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100:\n\n(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97)\n\n\n=== Inverse Pythagorean theorem ===\nGiven a right triangle with sides \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a,b,c}\n   and altitude \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n   (a line from the right angle and perpendicular to the hypotenuse \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n  ).

Pythagoras' theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the square root operation.\nThe figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer. Each triangle has a side (labeled \"1\") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras' theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as \u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a5 . For more detail, see Quadratic irrational.\nIncommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit. According to one legend, Hippasus of Metapontum (ca. 470 B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable.\n\n\n=== Complex numbers ===\n\nFor any complex number\n\n  \n    \n      \n        z\n        =\n        x\n        +\n        i\n        y\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z=x+iy,}\n  the absolute value or modulus is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        z\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              x\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              y\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r=|z|={\\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}\n  So the three quantities, r, x and y are related by the Pythagorean equation,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}.}\n  Note that r is defined to be a positive number or zero but x and y can be negative as well as positive.

widely used in optimization theory and statistics, forming the basis of least squares.\n\n\n=== Euclidean distance in other coordinate systems ===\nIf Cartesian coordinates are not used, for example, if polar coordinates are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if curvilinear coordinates are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the applications of Legendre polynomials in physics. The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras' theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) can be introduced as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        r\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        ,\n         \n        y\n        =\n        r\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=r\\cos \\theta ,\\ y=r\\sin \\theta .}\n  Then two points with locations (r1,

This was known by Hippocrates of Chios in the 5th century BC, and was included by Euclid in his Elements:\nIf one erects similar figures (see Euclidean geometry) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.\nThis extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are a:b:c). While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas A, B and C are erected on sides with corresponding lengths a, b and c then:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            B\n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {A}{a^{2}}}={\\frac {B}{b^{2}}}={\\frac {C}{c^{2}}}\\,,}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u21d2\n        A\n        +\n        B\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        C\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        C\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Rightarrow A+B={\\frac {a^{2}}{c^{2}}}C+{\\frac {b^{2}}{c^{2}}}C\\,.}\n  But, by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, so A + B = C.\nConversely, if we can prove that A + B = C for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle C on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (A and B ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its altitude. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus A + B = C and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a2 + b2 = c2. (See also Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement)\n\n\n=== Law of cosines ===\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the more general theorem relating the lengths of sides in any triangle, the law of cosines, which states that\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   is the angle between sides \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  .When \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{2}}}\n   radians or 90\u00b0, then \n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \u03b8\n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos {\\theta }=0}\n  , and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem.\n\n\n=== Arbitrary triangle ===\n\nAt any selected angle of a general triangle of sides a, b, c, inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base \u03b8 are the same as the selected angle. Suppose the selected angle \u03b8 is opposite the side labeled c. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle CAD with angle \u03b8 opposite side b and with side r along c. A second triangle is formed with angle \u03b8 opposite side a and a side with length s along c, as shown in the figure. Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        c\n        (\n        r\n        +\n        s\n        )\n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c(r+s)\\ .}\n  As the angle \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths r and s overlap less and less. When \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, ADB becomes a right triangle, r + s = c, and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained.\nOne proof observes that triangle ABC has the same angles as triangle CAD, but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex A, both contain the angle \u03b8, and so also have the same third angle by the triangle postulate.) Consequently, ABC is similar to the reflection of CAD, the triangle DAC in the lower panel.

The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras' theorem, and was considered a generalization by Pappus of Alexandria in 4 ADThe lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base b and height h. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms.\n\n\n=== Solid geometry ===\n\nIn terms of solid geometry, Pythagoras' theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows.

However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras' theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.\nA substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is de Gua's theorem, named for Jean Paul de Gua de Malves: If a tetrahedron has a right angle corner (like a corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the \"n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem\":\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n}}\n   be orthogonal vectors in Rn. Consider the n-dimensional simplex S with vertices \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0,x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}}\n  . (Think of the (n \u2212 1)-dimensional simplex with vertices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}}\n   not including the origin as the \"hypotenuse\" of S and the remaining (n \u2212 1)-dimensional faces of S as its \"legs\".) Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of S is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the n legs.\nThis statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The \"hypotenuse\" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the \"legs\" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the \"legs\" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras' theorem applies. In a different wording:\nGiven an n-rectangular n-dimensional simplex, the square of the (n \u2212 1)-content of the facet opposing the right vertex will equal the sum of the squares of the (n \u2212 1)-contents of the remaining facets.\n\n\n=== Inner product spaces ===\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to inner product spaces, which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces. For example, a function may be considered as a vector with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in functional analysis.In an inner product space, the concept of perpendicularity is replaced by the concept of orthogonality: two vectors v and w are orthogonal if their inner product \n  \n    \n      \n        \u27e8\n        \n          v\n        \n        ,\n        \n          w\n        \n        \u27e9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle \\mathbf {v} ,\\mathbf {w} \\rangle }\n   is zero. The inner product is a generalization of the dot product of vectors. The dot product is called the standard inner product or the Euclidean inner product. However, other inner products are possible.The concept of length is replaced by the concept of the norm \u2016v\u2016 of a vector v, defined as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        \n          v\n        \n        \u2016\n        \u2261\n        \n          \n            \u27e8\n            \n              v\n            \n            ,\n            \n              v\n            \n            \u27e9\n          \n        \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lVert \\mathbf {v} \\rVert \\equiv {\\sqrt {\\langle \\mathbf {v} ,\\mathbf {v} \\rangle }}\\,.}\n  In an inner-product space, the Pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors v and w we have\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u2016\n            \n              \n                v\n              \n              +\n              \n                w\n              \n            \n            \u2016\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \u2016\n            \n              v\n            \n            \u2016\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \u2016\n            \n              w\n            \n            \u2016\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\|\\mathbf {v} +\\mathbf {w} \\right\\|^{2}=\\left\\|\\mathbf {v} \\right\\|^{2}+\\left\\|\\mathbf {w} \\right\\|^{2}.}\n  Here the vectors v and w are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the vector sum v + w.

More precisely, the Pythagorean theorem implies, and is implied by, Euclid's Parallel (Fifth) Postulate. Thus, right triangles in a non-Euclidean geometry\ndo not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in spherical geometry, all three sides of the right triangle (say a, b, and c) bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to \u03c0/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        2\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        >\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=2c^{2}>c^{2}}\n  .\nHere two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered\u2014spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines.\nHowever, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say A+B = C. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters a and b equals the area of the circle with diameter c.\n\n\n==== Spherical geometry ====\n\nFor any right triangle on a sphere of radius R (for example, if \u03b3 in the figure is a right angle), with sides a, b, c, the relation between the sides takes the form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            c\n            R\n          \n        \n        =\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            a\n            R\n          \n        \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            b\n            R\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos {\\frac {c}{R}}=\\cos {\\frac {a}{R}}\\,\\cos {\\frac {b}{R}}.}\n  This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines that applies to all spherical triangles:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            c\n            R\n          \n        \n        =\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            a\n            R\n          \n        \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            b\n            R\n          \n        \n        +\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            a\n            R\n          \n        \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            b\n            R\n          \n        \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          \u03b3\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos {\\frac {c}{R}}=\\cos {\\frac {a}{R}}\\,\\cos {\\frac {b}{R}}+\\sin {\\frac {a}{R}}\\,\\sin {\\frac {b}{R}}\\,\\cos {\\gamma }.}\n  For infinitesimal triangles on the sphere (or equivalently, for finite spherical triangles on a sphere of infinite radius), the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle reduces to the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. To see how, assume we have a spherical triangle of fixed side lengths a, b, and c on a sphere with expanding radius R.

Historians of Mesopotamian mathematics have concluded that the Pythagorean rule was in widespread use during the Old Babylonian period (20th to 16th centuries BC), over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born. The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system.\nWritten c. 1800 BC, the Egyptian Middle Kingdom Berlin Papyrus 6619 includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet Plimpton 322, also written c. 1800 BC near Larsa, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.In India, the Baudhayana Shulba Sutra, the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples and a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, both in the special case of the isosceles right triangle and in the general case, as does the Apastamba Shulba Sutra (c. 600 BC).Byzantine Neoplatonic philosopher and mathematician Proclus, writing in the fifth century AD, states two arithmetic rules, \"one of them attributed to Plato, the other to Pythagoras\", for generating special Pythagorean triples.  The rule attributed to Pythagoras (c.\u2009570 \u2013 c.\u2009495 BC) starts from an odd number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by one unit; the rule attributed to Plato (428/427 or 424/423 \u2013 348/347 BC) starts from an even number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by two units. According to Thomas L. Heath (1861\u20131940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted. Classicist Kurt von Fritz wrote, \"Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, but one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics.\" Around 300 BC, in Euclid's Elements, the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented.\n\nWith contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the Chinese text Zhoubi Suanjing (\u5468\u9ac0\u7b97\u7ecf), (The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven) gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle \u2014 in China it is called the \"Gougu theorem\" (\u52fe\u80a1\u5b9a\u7406). During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, together with a mention of right triangles. Some believe the theorem arose first in China, where it is alternatively known as the \"Shang Gao theorem\" (\u5546\u9ad8\u5b9a\u7406), named after the Duke of Zhou's astronomer and mathematician, whose reasoning composed most of what was in the Zhoubi Suanjing.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nPythagorean theorem at ProofWiki\nEuclid (1997) [c. 300 BC].

MathWorld.", "Similarity_(geometry)": "In Euclidean geometry, two objects are similar if they have the same shape, or if one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is congruent to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.\n\nFor example, all circles are similar to each other, all squares are similar to each other, and all equilateral triangles are similar to each other. On the other hand, ellipses are not all similar to each other, rectangles are not all similar to each other, and isosceles triangles are not all similar to each other. This is because two ellipses can have different width to height ratios, two rectangles can have different length to breadth ratios, and two isosceles triangles can have different base angles. \n\nIf two angles of a triangle have measures equal to the measures of two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar. Corresponding sides of similar polygons are in proportion, and corresponding angles of similar polygons have the same measure.\nTwo congruent shapes are similar, with a scale factor of 1. However, some school textbooks specifically exclude congruent triangles from their definition of similar triangles by insisting that the sizes must be different if the triangles are to qualify as similar.\n\n\n== Similar triangles ==\nTwo triangles, \u25b3ABC and \u25b3A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032 are similar if and only if corresponding angles have the same measure: this implies that they are similar if and only if the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. It can be shown that two triangles having congruent angles (equiangular triangles) are similar, that is, the corresponding sides can be proved to be proportional. This is known as the AAA similarity theorem. Note that the \"AAA\" is a mnemonic: each one of the three A's refers to an \"angle\". Due to this theorem, several authors simplify the definition of similar triangles to only require that the corresponding three angles are congruent.There are several criteria each of which is necessary and sufficient for two triangles to be similar:\n\nAny two pairs of angles are congruent, which in Euclidean geometry implies that all three angles are congruent:If \u2220BAC is equal in measure to \u2220B\u2032A\u2032C\u2032, and \u2220ABC is equal in measure to \u2220A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032, then this implies that \u2220ACB is equal in measure to \u2220A\u2032C\u2032B\u2032 and the triangles are similar.All the corresponding sides are proportional:AB/A\u2032B\u2032 = BC/B\u2032C\u2032 = AC/A\u2032C\u2032. This is equivalent to saying that one triangle (or its mirror image) is an enlargement of the other.Any two pairs of sides are proportional, and the angles included between these sides are congruent:AB/A\u2032B\u2032 = BC/B\u2032C\u2032 and \u2220ABC is equal in measure to \u2220A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032.This is known as the SAS similarity criterion. The \"SAS\" is a mnemonic: each one of the two S's refers to a \"side\"; the A refers to an \"angle\" between the two sides.\nSymbolically, we write the similarity and dissimilarity of two triangles\u25b3ABC and \u25b3A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032 as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        \u223c\n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          B\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          C\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABC\\sim A'B'C'}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        \u2241\n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          B\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          C\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABC\\nsim A'B'C'}\n  There are several elementary results concerning similar triangles in Euclidean geometry:\nAny two equilateral triangles are similar.\nTwo triangles, both similar to a third triangle, are similar to each other (transitivity of similarity of triangles).\nCorresponding altitudes of similar triangles have the same ratio as the corresponding sides.\nTwo right triangles are similar if the hypotenuse and one other side have lengths in the same ratio. There are several equivalent conditions in this case, such as the right triangles having an acute angle of the same measure, or having the lengths of the legs (sides) being in the same proportion.Given a triangle \u25b3ABC and a line segment DE one can, with a ruler and compass, find a point F such that \u25b3ABC ~ \u25b3DEF. The statement that point F satisfying this condition exists is Wallis's postulate and is logically equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. In hyperbolic geometry (where Wallis's postulate is false) similar triangles are congruent.\nIn the axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry given by George David Birkhoff (see Birkhoff's axioms) the SAS similarity criterion given above was used to replace both Euclid's parallel postulate and the SAS axiom which enabled the dramatic shortening of Hilbert's axioms.Similar triangles provide the basis for many synthetic (without the use of coordinates) proofs in Euclidean geometry. Among the elementary results that can be proved this way are: the angle bisector theorem, the geometric mean theorem, Ceva's theorem, Menelaus's theorem and the Pythagorean theorem. Similar triangles also provide the foundations for right triangle trigonometry.\n\n\n== Other similar polygons ==\n\nThe concept of similarity extends to polygons with more than three sides. Given any two similar polygons, corresponding sides taken in the same sequence (even if clockwise for one polygon and counterclockwise for the other) are proportional and corresponding angles taken in the same sequence are equal in measure. However, proportionality of corresponding sides is not by itself sufficient to prove similarity for polygons beyond triangles (otherwise, for example, all rhombi would be similar). Likewise, equality of all angles in sequence is not sufficient to guarantee similarity (otherwise all rectangles would be similar). A sufficient condition for similarity of polygons is that corresponding sides and diagonals are proportional.\nFor given n, all regular n-gons are similar.\n\n\n== Similar curves ==\nSeveral types of curves have the property that all examples of that type are similar to each other. These include:\n\nLines (any two lines are even congruent)\nLine segments\nCircles\nParabolas\nHyperbolas of a specific eccentricity\nEllipses of a specific eccentricity\nCatenaries\nGraphs of the logarithm function for different bases\nGraphs of the exponential function for different bases\nLogarithmic spirals are self-similar\n\n\n== In Euclidean space ==\nA similarity (also called a similarity transformation or similitude) of a Euclidean space is a bijection f from the space onto itself that multiplies all distances by the same positive real number r, so that for any two points x and y we have\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        f\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        r\n        \n        d\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        ,\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))=r\\,d(x,y),\\,}\n  where \"d(x,y)\" is the Euclidean distance from x to y. The scalar r has many names in the literature including; the ratio of similarity, the stretching factor and the similarity coefficient. When r = 1 a similarity is called an isometry (rigid transformation). Two sets are called similar if one is the image of the other under a similarity.\nAs a map f : \u211dn \u2192 \u211dn, a similarity of ratio r takes the form\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        r\n        A\n        x\n        +\n        t\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=rAx+t,}\n  where A \u2208 On(\u211d) is an n \u00d7 n orthogonal matrix and t \u2208 \u211dn is a translation vector.\nSimilarities preserve planes, lines, perpendicularity, parallelism, midpoints, inequalities between distances and line segments. Similarities preserve angles but do not necessarily preserve orientation, direct similitudes preserve orientation and opposite similitudes change it.The similarities of Euclidean space form a group under the operation of composition called the similarities group S. The direct similitudes form a normal subgroup of S and the Euclidean group E(n) of isometries also forms a normal subgroup. The similarities group S is itself a subgroup of the affine group, so every similarity is an affine transformation.\nOne can view the Euclidean plane as the complex plane, that is, as a 2-dimensional space over the reals. The 2D similarity transformations can then be expressed in terms of complex arithmetic and are given by f(z) = az + b (direct similitudes) and f(z) = az + b (opposite similitudes), where a and b are complex numbers, a \u2260 0. When |a| = 1, these similarities are isometries.\n\n\n== Area ratio and volume ratio ==\n\nThe ratio between the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the side of a square or the radius of a circle is multiplied by three, its area is multiplied by nine \u2014 i.e. by three squared). The altitudes of similar triangles are in the same ratio as corresponding sides. If a triangle has a side of length b and an altitude drawn to that side of length h then a similar triangle with corresponding side of length kb will have an altitude drawn to that side of length kh. The area of the first triangle is, A = 1/2bh, while the area of the similar triangle will be A\u2032 = 1/2(kb)(kh) = k2A. Similar figures which can be decomposed into similar triangles will have areas related in the same way. The relationship holds for figures that are not rectifiable as well.\nThe ratio between the volumes of similar figures is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the edge of a cube or the radius of a sphere is multiplied by three, its volume is multiplied by 27 \u2014 i.e. by three cubed).\nGalileo's square\u2013cube law concerns similar solids. If the ratio of similitude (ratio of corresponding sides) between the solids is k, then the ratio of surface areas of the solids will be k2, while the ratio of volumes will be k3.\n\n\n== Similarity with a center ==\n\nIf a similarity has exactly one invariant point: a point that the similarity keeps unchanged, then this only point is called \"center\" of the similarity.\nOn the first image below the title, on the left, one or another similarity shrinks a regular polygon into a concentric one, the vertices of which are each on a side of the previous polygon. This rotational reduction is repeated, so the initial polygon is extended into an abyss of regular polygons. The center of the similarity is the common center of the successive polygons. A red segment joins a vertex of the initial polygon to its image under the similarity, followed by a red segment going to the following image of vertex, and so on to form a spiral. Actually we can see more than three direct similarities on this first image, because every regular polygon is invariant under certain direct similarities, more precisely certain rotations the center of which is the center of the polygon, and a composition of direct similarities is also a direct similarity. For example we see the image of the initial regular pentagon under a homothety of negative \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ratio \n        \n        \u2212\n        k\n        ,\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{ratio }}-k,\\,}\n   which is a similarity of \u00b1180\u00b0 angle and a positive ratio \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          equal to \n        \n        k\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{equal to }}k.}\n  \nBelow the title on the right, the second image shows a similarity decomposed into a rotation and a homothety.

The similarity is a function such that its value is greater when two points are closer (contrary to the distance, which is a measure of dissimilarity: the closer the points, the lesser the distance).\nThe definition of the similarity can vary among authors, depending on which properties are desired. The basic common properties are\n\nPositive defined:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2200\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ,\n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        \u2265\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall (a,b),S(a,b)\\geq 0}\n  \nMajored by the similarity of one element on itself (auto-similarity):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        \u2264\n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        a\n        )\n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        \u2200\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ,\n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        a\n        )\n        \u21d4\n        a\n        =\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S(a,b)\\leq S(a,a)\\quad {\\text{and}}\\quad \\forall (a,b),S(a,b)=S(a,a)\\Leftrightarrow a=b}\n  More properties can be invoked, such as reflectivity (\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2200\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n         \n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        S\n        (\n        b\n        ,\n        a\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall (a,b)\\ S(a,b)=S(b,a)}\n  ) or finiteness (\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2200\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n         \n        S\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        <\n        \u221e\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall (a,b)\\ S(a,b)<\\infty }\n  ). The upper value is often set at 1 (creating a possibility for a probabilistic interpretation of the similitude).\nNote that, in the topological sense used here, a similarity is a kind of measure. This usage is not the same as the similarity transformation of the \u00a7 In Euclidean space and \u00a7 In general metric spaces sections of this article.\n\n\n== Self-similarity ==\nSelf-similarity means that a pattern is non-trivially similar to itself, e.g., the set {..., 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, ...} of numbers of the form {{math|{2i, 3\u00b72i}} where i ranges over all integers. When this set is plotted on a logarithmic scale it has one-dimensional translational symmetry: adding or subtracting the logarithm of two to the logarithm of one of these numbers produces the logarithm of another of these numbers. In the given set of numbers themselves, this corresponds to a similarity transformation in which the numbers are multiplied or divided by two.\n\n\n== Psychology ==\nThe intuition for the notion of geometric similarity already appears in human children, as can be seen in their drawings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCongruence (geometry)\nHamming distance (string or sequence similarity)\nHelmert transformation\nInversive geometry\nJaccard index\nProportionality\nBasic proportionality theorem\nSemantic similarity\nSimilarity search\nSimilarity (philosophy)\nSimilarity space on numerical taxonomy\nHomoeoid (shell of concentric, similar ellipsoids)\nSolution of triangles\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHenderson, David W.; Taimi\u0146a, Daina (2005).

For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0. This is called an \"angle-based\" right triangle. A \"side-based\" right triangle is one in which the lengths of the sides form ratios of whole numbers, such as 3 : 4 : 5, or of other special numbers such as the golden ratio. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these special right triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without resorting to more advanced methods.\n\n\n== Angle-based ==\n\nAngle-based special right triangles are specified by the relationships of the angles of which the triangle is composed. The angles of these triangles are such that the larger (right) angle, which is 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians, is equal to the sum of the other two angles.\nThe side lengths are generally deduced from the basis of the unit circle or other geometric methods.  This approach may be used to rapidly reproduce the values of trigonometric functions for the angles 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0.\nSpecial triangles are used to aid in calculating common trigonometric functions, as below:\n\nThe 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle, the 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle, and the equilateral/equiangular (60\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201360\u00b0) triangle are the three M\u00f6bius triangles in the plane, meaning that they tessellate the plane via reflections in their sides; see Triangle group.\n\n\n=== 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle ===\n\nIn plane geometry, constructing the diagonal of a square results in a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 1 : 2, adding up to 180\u00b0 or \u03c0 radians.  Hence, the angles respectively measure 45\u00b0 (\u03c0/4), 45\u00b0 (\u03c0/4), and 90\u00b0 (\u03c0/2).  The sides in this triangle are in the ratio 1 : 1 : \u221a2, which follows immediately from the Pythagorean theorem.\nOf all right triangles, the 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 degree triangle has the smallest ratio of the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely \u221a2/2.:\u200ap.282,\u200ap.358\u200a and the greatest ratio of the altitude from the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely \u221a2/4.:\u200ap.282\u200aTriangles with these angles are the only possible right triangles that are also isosceles triangles in Euclidean geometry. However, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, there are infinitely many different shapes of right isosceles triangles.\n\n\n=== 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle ===\n\nThis is a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 and respectively measure 30\u00b0 (\u03c0/6), 60\u00b0 (\u03c0/3), and 90\u00b0 (\u03c0/2). The sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2.\nThe proof of this fact is clear using trigonometry.  The geometric proof is:\n\nDraw an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 2 and with point D as the midpoint of segment BC.  Draw an altitude line from A to D.  Then ABD is a 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle with hypotenuse of length 2, and base BD of length 1.The fact that the remaining leg AD has length \u221a3 follows immediately from the Pythagorean theorem.The 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. The proof of this fact is simple and follows on from the fact that if \u03b1, \u03b1 + \u03b4, \u03b1 + 2\u03b4 are the angles in the progression then the sum of the angles 3\u03b1 + 3\u03b4 = 180\u00b0. After dividing by 3, the angle \u03b1 + \u03b4 must be 60\u00b0. The right angle is 90\u00b0, leaving the remaining angle to be 30\u00b0.\n\n\n== Side-based ==\nRight triangles whose sides are of integer lengths, with the sides collectively known as Pythagorean triples, possess angles that cannot all be rational numbers of degrees.  (This follows from Niven's theorem.) They are most useful in that they may be easily remembered and any multiple of the sides produces the same relationship. Using Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples, the sides must be in the ratio\n\nm2 \u2212 n2 : 2mn : m2 + n2where m and n are any positive integers such that m > n.\n\n\n=== Common Pythagorean triples ===\n\nThere are several Pythagorean triples which are well-known, including those with sides in the ratios:\n\nThe 3 : 4 : 5 triangles are the only right triangles with edges in arithmetic progression. Triangles based on Pythagorean triples are Heronian, meaning they have integer area as well as integer sides.\nThe possible use of the 3 : 4 : 5 triangle in Ancient Egypt, with the supposed use of a knotted rope to lay out such a triangle, and the question whether Pythagoras' theorem was known at that time, have been much debated. It was first conjectured by the historian Moritz Cantor in 1882. It is known that right angles were laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt; that their surveyors did use ropes for measurement;  that Plutarch recorded in Isis and Osiris (around 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3 : 4 : 5 triangle;  and that the Berlin Papyrus 6619 from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (before 1700 BC) stated that \"the area of a square of 100 is equal to that of two smaller squares. The side of one is \u00bd + \u00bc  the side of the other.\" The historian of mathematics Roger L. Cooke observes that \"It is hard to imagine anyone being interested in such conditions without knowing the Pythagorean theorem.\"  Against this, Cooke notes that no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle's sides, and that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. Cooke concludes that Cantor's conjecture remains uncertain: he guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but that \"there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles\".The following are all the Pythagorean triple ratios expressed in lowest form (beyond the five smallest ones in lowest form in the list above) with both non-hypotenuse sides less than 256:\n\n\n=== Almost-isosceles Pythagorean triples ===\nIsosceles right-angled triangles cannot have sides with integer values, because the ratio of the hypotenuse to either other side is \u221a2 and \u221a2 cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. However, infinitely many almost-isosceles right triangles do exist. These are right-angled triangles with integer sides for which the lengths of the non-hypotenuse edges differ by one. Such almost-isosceles right-angled triangles can be obtained recursively,\n\na0 = 1, b0 = 2\nan = 2bn\u22121 + an\u22121\nbn = 2an + bn\u22121an is length of hypotenuse, n = 1, 2, 3, ....

(sequence A000129 in the OEIS)..  The smallest Pythagorean triples resulting are:\nAlternatively, the same triangles can be derived from the square triangular numbers.\n\n\n=== Arithmetic and geometric progressions ===\n\nThe Kepler triangle is a right triangle whose sides are in geometric progression. If the sides are formed from the geometric progression a, ar, ar2 then its common ratio r is given by r = \u221a\u03c6 where \u03c6 is the golden ratio. Its sides are therefore in the ratio 1 : \u221a\u03c6 : \u03c6. Thus, the shape of the Kepler triangle is uniquely determined (up to a scale factor) by the requirement that its sides be in geometric progression.\nThe 3\u20134\u20135 triangle is the unique right triangle (up to scaling) whose sides are in arithmetic progression.\n\n\n=== Sides of regular polygons ===\n\nLet  be the side length of a regular decagon inscribed in the unit circle, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi }\n   is the golden ratio.

A triangle whose sides form a Pythagorean triple is called a Pythagorean triangle, and is necessarily a right triangle.\nThe name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}\n  ; thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle. However, right triangles with non-integer sides do not form Pythagorean triples. For instance, the triangle with sides \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        b\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a=b=1}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        =\n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c={\\sqrt {2}}}\n   is a right triangle, but \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        1\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (1,1,{\\sqrt {2}})}\n   is not a Pythagorean triple because \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n   is not an integer.

The oldest known record comes from Plimpton 322, a Babylonian clay tablet from about 1800 BC, written in a sexagesimal number system. It was discovered by Edgar James Banks shortly after 1900, and sold to George Arthur Plimpton in 1922, for $10.When searching for integer solutions, the equation a2 + b2 = c2 is a Diophantine equation. Thus Pythagorean triples are among the oldest known solutions of a nonlinear Diophantine equation.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThere are 16 primitive Pythagorean triples of numbers up to 100:\n\nOther small Pythagorean triples such as (6, 8, 10) are not listed because they are not primitive; for instance (6, 8, 10) is a multiple of (3, 4, 5).\nEach of these points (with their multiples) forms a radiating line in the scatter plot to the right. \nAdditionally, these are the remaining primitive Pythagorean triples of numbers up to 300:\n\n\n== Generating a triple ==\n\nEuclid's formula is a fundamental formula for generating Pythagorean triples given an arbitrary pair of integers m and n with m > n > 0. The formula states that the integers\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n         \n        \n        b\n        =\n        2\n        m\n        n\n        ,\n         \n        \n        c\n        =\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a=m^{2}-n^{2},\\ \\,b=2mn,\\ \\,c=m^{2}+n^{2}}\n  form a Pythagorean triple. The triple generated by Euclid's formula is primitive if and only if m and n are coprime and one of them is even.  When both m and n are odd, then a, b, and c will be even, and the triple will not be primitive; however, dividing a, b, and c by 2 will yield a primitive triple when m and n are coprime.Every primitive triple arises (after the exchange of a and b, if a is even) from a unique pair of coprime numbers m, n, one of which is even. It follows that there are infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples. This relationship of a, b and c to m and n from Euclid's formula is referenced throughout the rest of this article.\nDespite generating all primitive triples, Euclid's formula does not produce all triples\u2014for example, (9, 12, 15) cannot be generated using integer m and n. This can be remedied by inserting an additional parameter k to the formula. The following will generate all Pythagorean triples uniquely:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        k\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n         \n        \n        b\n        =\n        k\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        2\n        m\n        n\n        )\n        ,\n         \n        \n        c\n        =\n        k\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a=k\\cdot (m^{2}-n^{2}),\\ \\,b=k\\cdot (2mn),\\ \\,c=k\\cdot (m^{2}+n^{2})}\n  where m, n, and k are positive integers with m > n, and with m and n coprime and not both odd.\nThat these formulas generate Pythagorean triples can be verified by expanding a2 + b2 using elementary algebra and verifying that the result equals c2. Since every Pythagorean triple can be divided through by some integer k to obtain a primitive triple, every triple can be generated uniquely by using the formula with m and n to generate its primitive counterpart and then multiplying through by k as in the last equation.\nChoosing m and n from certain integer sequences gives interesting results. For example, if m and n are consecutive Pell numbers, a and b will differ by 1.Many formulas for generating triples with particular properties have been developed since the time of Euclid.\n\n\n=== Proof of Euclid's formula ===\nThat satisfaction of Euclid's formula by a, b, c is sufficient for the triangle to be Pythagorean is apparent from the fact that for positive integers m and n, m > n, the a, b, and c given by the formula are all positive integers, and from the fact that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        (\n        2\n        m\n        n\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=(m^{2}-n^{2})^{2}+(2mn)^{2}=(m^{2}+n^{2})^{2}=c^{2}.}\n  A proof of the necessity that a, b, c be expressed by Euclid's formula for any primitive Pythagorean triple is as follows. All such primitive triples can be written as (a, b, c) where a2 + b2 = c2 and a, b, c are coprime. Thus a, b, c are pairwise coprime (if a prime number divided two of them, it would be forced also to divide the third one). As a and b are coprime, at least one of them is odd, so we may suppose that a is odd, by exchanging, if needed, a and b. This implies that b is even and c is odd (if b were odd, c would be even, and c2 would be a multiple of 4, while a2 + b2 would be congruent to 2 modulo 4, as an odd square is congruent to 1 modulo 4).\nFrom \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}\n   we obtain \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c^{2}-a^{2}=b^{2}}\n   and hence \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        c\n        \u2212\n        a\n        )\n        (\n        c\n        +\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (c-a)(c+a)=b^{2}}\n  .

Since 4 would be the minimum possible even factor in the numerator and 2 would be the maximum possible even factor in the denominator, this would imply a to be even despite defining it as odd. Thus one of m and n is odd and the other is even, and the numerators of the two fractions with denominator 2mn are odd. Thus these fractions are fully reduced (an odd prime dividing this denominator divides one of m and n but not the other; thus it does not divide m2 \u00b1 n2).

Conversely, every primitive Pythagorean triple arises (after the exchange of a and b, if a is even) from a unique pair m > n > 0 of coprime odd integers.\n\n\n== Elementary properties of primitive Pythagorean triples ==\n\n\n=== General properties ===\nThe properties of a primitive Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) with a < b < c (without specifying which of a or b is even and which is odd) include:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n                c\n                \u2212\n                a\n                )\n                (\n                c\n                \u2212\n                b\n                )\n              \n              2\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {(c-a)(c-b)}{2}}}\n   is always a perfect square. As it is only a necessary condition but not a sufficient one, it can be used in checking if a given triple of numbers is not a Pythagorean triple when they fail the test.  For example, the triples {6, 12, 18} and {1, 8, 9} each pass the test that (c \u2212 a)(c \u2212 b)/2 is a perfect square, but neither is a Pythagorean triple.\nWhen a triple of numbers a, b and c forms a primitive Pythagorean triple, then (c minus the even leg) and one-half of (c minus the odd leg) are both perfect squares; however this is not a sufficient condition, as the numbers {1, 8, 9} pass the perfect squares test but are not a Pythagorean triple since 12 + 82 \u2260 92.\nAt most one of a, b, c is a square.\nThe area of a Pythagorean triangle cannot be the square:\u200ap. 17\u200a or twice the square:\u200ap. 21\u200a of a natural number.\nExactly one of a, b is divisible by 2 (is even), but never c.\nExactly one of a, b is divisible by 3, but never c.:\u200a23\u201325\u200a\nExactly one of a, b is divisible by 4, but never c (because c is never even).\nExactly one of a, b, c is divisible by 5.\nThe largest number that always divides abc is 60.\nAny odd number of the form 2m+1, where m is an integer and m>1, can be the odd leg of a primitive Pythagorean triple [PPT]. See almost-isosceles PPT section below. However, only even numbers divisible by 4 can be the even leg of a PPT. This is because Euclid's formula for the even leg given above is 2mn and one of m or n must be even.\nThe hypotenuse c is the sum of two squares. This requires all of its prime factors to be primes of the form 4n + 1. Therefore, c is of the form 4n + 1. A sequence of possible hypotenuse numbers for a PPT can be found at (sequence A008846 in the OEIS).\nThe area (K = ab/2) is a congruent number divisible by 6.\nIn every Pythagorean triangle, the radius of the incircle and the radii of the three excircles are natural numbers. Specifically, for a primitive triple the radius of the incircle is r = n(m \u2212 n), and the radii of the excircles opposite the sides m2 \u2212 n2, 2mn, and the hypotenuse m2 + n2 are respectively m(m \u2212 n), n(m + n), and m(m + n).\nAs for any right triangle, the converse of Thales' theorem says that the diameter of the circumcircle equals the hypotenuse; hence for primitive triples the circumdiameter is m2 + n2, and the circumradius is half of this and thus is rational but non-integer (since m and n have opposite parity).\nWhen the area of a Pythagorean triangle is multiplied by the curvatures of its incircle and 3 excircles, the result is four positive integers w > x > y > z, respectively. Integers \u2212w, x, y, z satisfy Descartes's Circle Equation. Equivalently, the radius of the outer Soddy circle of any right triangle is equal to its semiperimeter. The outer Soddy center is located at D, where ACBD is a rectangle, ACB the right triangle and AB its hypotenuse.:\u200ap. 6\u200a\nOnly two sides of a primitive Pythagorean triple can be simultaneously prime because by Euclid's formula for generating a primitive Pythagorean triple, one of the legs must be composite and even.

(This follows from Niven's theorem.)\n\n\n=== Special cases ===\nIn addition, special Pythagorean triples with certain additional properties can be guaranteed to exist:\n\nEvery integer greater than 2 that is not congruent to 2 mod 4 (in other words, every integer greater than 2 which is not of the form 4k + 2) is part of a primitive Pythagorean triple. (If the integer has the form 4k, one may take n = 1 and m = 2k in Euclid's formula; if the integer is 2k + 1, one may take n = k and  m = k + 1.)\nEvery integer greater than 2 is part of a primitive or non-primitive Pythagorean triple.  For example, the integers 6, 10, 14, and 18 are not part of primitive triples, but are part of the non-primitive triples (6, 8, 10), (14, 48, 50) and (18, 80, 82).\nThere exist infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuse and the longest leg differ by exactly one. Such triples are necessarily primitive and have the form (2n + 1, 2n2 + 2n, 2n2 + 2n +1). This results from Euclid's formula by remarking that the condition implies that the triple is primitive and must verify (m2 + n2) - 2mn = 1. This implies (m \u2013 n)2 = 1, and thus m = n + 1. The above form of the triples results thus of substituting m for n + 1 in Euclid's formula.\nThere exist infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuse and the longest leg differ by exactly two. They are all primitive, and are obtained by putting n = 1 in Euclid's formula. More generally, for every integer k > 0, there exist infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuse and the odd leg differ by 2k2. They are obtained by putting n = k in Euclid's formula.\nThere exist infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the two legs differ by exactly one.

In this case, the number of primitive Pythagorean triples (a, b, c) with a < b is 2k\u22121, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of c.\nThere exist infinitely many Pythagorean triples with square numbers for both the hypotenuse c and the sum of the legs a + b. According to Fermat, the smallest such triple has sides a = 4,565,486,027,761; b = 1,061,652,293,520; and c = 4,687,298,610,289. Here a + b = 2,372,1592 and c = 2,165,0172. This is generated by Euclid's formula with parameter values m = 2,150,905 and n = 246,792.\nThere exist non-primitive Pythagorean triangles with integer altitude from the hypotenuse. Such Pythagorean triangles are known as decomposable since they can be split along this altitude into two separate and smaller Pythagorean triangles.\n\n\n== Geometry of Euclid's formula ==\n\n\n=== Rational points on a unit circle ===\n\nEuclid's formula for a Pythagorean triple\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        b\n        =\n        2\n        m\n        n\n        ,\n        \n        c\n        =\n        \n          m\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a=m^{2}-n^{2},\\quad b=2mn,\\quad c=m^{2}+n^{2}}\n  can be understood in terms of the geometry of rational points on the unit circle (Trautman 1998).\nIn fact, a point in the Cartesian plane with coordinates (x, y) belongs to the unit circle if x2 + y2 = 1.

The unit circle is thus called a rational curve, and it is this fact which enables an explicit parameterization of the (rational number) points on it by means of rational functions.\n\n\n== Pythagorean triangles in a 2D lattice ==\nA 2D lattice is a regular array of isolated points where if any one point is chosen as the Cartesian origin (0, 0), then all the other points are at (x, y) where x and y range over all positive and negative integers.

As yet, no set of three primitive Pythagorean triples have been found sharing the same interior lattice count.\n\n\n== Enumeration of primitive Pythagorean triples ==\nBy Euclid's formula all primitive Pythagorean triples can be generated from integers \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   with \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        >\n        n\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m>n>0}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        +\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m+n}\n   odd and \n  \n    \n      \n        gcd\n        (\n        m\n        ,\n        n\n        )\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gcd(m,n)=1}\n  .

If X corresponds to a Pythagorean triple, then as a matrix it must have rank 1.\nSince X is symmetric, it follows from a result in linear algebra that there is a column vector \u03be = [m n]T such that the outer product\n\nholds, where the T denotes the matrix transpose. The vector \u03be is called a spinor (for the Lorentz group SO(1, 2)). In abstract terms, the Euclid formula means that each primitive Pythagorean triple can be written as the outer product with itself of a spinor with integer entries, as in (1).\nThe modular group \u0393 is the set of 2\u00d72 matrices with integer entries\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \u03b1\n                \n                \n                  \u03b2\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \u03b3\n                \n                \n                  \u03b4\n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A={\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha &\\beta \\\\\\gamma &\\delta \\end{bmatrix}}}\n  with determinant equal to one: \u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 = 1. This set forms a group, since the inverse of a matrix in \u0393 is again in \u0393, as is the product of two matrices in \u0393. The modular group acts on the collection of all integer spinors. Furthermore, the group is transitive on the collection of integer spinors with relatively prime entries.

Thus if A is a matrix in \u0393, then\n\ngives rise to an action on the matrix X in (1). This does not give a well-defined action on primitive triples, since it may take a primitive triple to an imprimitive one. It is convenient at this point (per Trautman 1998) to call a triple (a,b,c) standard if c > 0 and either (a,b,c) are relatively prime or (a/2,b/2,c/2) are relatively prime with a/2 odd. If the spinor [m n]T has relatively prime entries, then the associated triple (a,b,c) determined by (1) is a standard triple. It follows that the action of the modular group is transitive on the set of standard triples.\nAlternatively, restrict attention to those values of m and n for which m is odd and n is even. Let the subgroup \u0393(2) of \u0393 be the kernel of the group homomorphism\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        =\n        \n          S\n          L\n        \n        (\n        2\n        ,\n        \n          Z\n        \n        )\n        \u2192\n        \n          S\n          L\n        \n        (\n        2\n        ,\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma =\\mathrm {SL} (2,\\mathbf {Z} )\\to \\mathrm {SL} (2,\\mathbf {Z} _{2})}\n  where SL(2,Z2) is the special linear group over the finite field Z2 of integers modulo 2. Then \u0393(2) is the group of unimodular transformations which preserve the parity of each entry. Thus if the first entry of \u03be is odd and the second entry is even, then the same is true of A\u03be for all A \u2208 \u0393(2). In fact, under the action (2), the group \u0393(2) acts transitively on the collection of primitive Pythagorean triples (Alperin 2005).\nThe group \u0393(2) is the free group whose generators are the matrices\n\n  \n    \n      \n        U\n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  0\n                \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        L\n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  2\n                \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U={\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}},\\qquad L={\\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\2&1\\end{bmatrix}}.}\n  Consequently, every primitive Pythagorean triple can be obtained in a unique way as a product of copies of the matrices U and L.\n\n\n== Parent/child relationships ==\n\nBy a result of Berggren (1934), all primitive Pythagorean triples can be generated from the (3, 4, 5) triangle by using the three linear transformations T1, T2, T3 below, where a, b, c are sides of a triple:\n\nIn other words, every primitive triple will be a \"parent\" to three additional primitive triples.\nStarting from the initial node with a = 3, b = 4, and c = 5, the operation T1 produces the new triple \n\n(3 \u2212 (2\u00d74) + (2\u00d75), (2\u00d73) \u2212 4 + (2\u00d75), (2\u00d73) \u2212 (2\u00d74) + (3\u00d75)) = (5, 12, 13),and similarly T2 and T3 produce the triples (21, 20, 29) and (15, 8, 17).\nThe linear transformations T1, T2, and T3 have a geometric interpretation in the language of quadratic forms. They are closely related to (but are not equal to) reflections generating the orthogonal group of x2 + y2 \u2212 z2 over the integers.\n\n\n== Relation to Gaussian integers ==\nAlternatively, Euclid's formulae can be analyzed and proved using the Gaussian integers. Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form \u03b1 = u + vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. The units of Gaussian integers are \u00b11 and \u00b1i. The ordinary integers are called the rational integers and denoted as 'Z'. The Gaussian integers are denoted as Z[i]. The right-hand side of the Pythagorean theorem may be factored in Gaussian integers:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        i\n        )\n        \n          \n            \n              (\n              a\n              +\n              b\n              i\n              )\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        i\n        )\n        (\n        a\n        \u2212\n        b\n        i\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}=(a+bi){\\overline {(a+bi)}}=(a+bi)(a-bi).}\n  A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a and b are coprime, i.e., they share no prime factors in the integers. For such a triple, either a or b is even, and the other is odd; from this, it follows that c is also odd.\nThe two factors z := a + bi and z* := a \u2212 bi of a primitive Pythagorean triple each equal the square of a Gaussian integer. This can be proved using the property that every Gaussian integer can be factored uniquely into Gaussian primes up to units. (This unique factorization follows from the fact that, roughly speaking, a version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined on them.) The proof has three steps. First, if a and b share no prime factors in the integers, then they also share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. (Assume a = gu and b = gv with Gaussian integers g, u and v and g not a unit. Then u and v lie on the same line through the origin. All Gaussian integers on such a line are integer multiples of some Gaussian integer h. But then the integer gh \u2260 \u00b11 divides both a and b.) Second, it follows that z and z* likewise share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. For if they did, then their common divisor \u03b4 would also divide z + z* = 2a and z \u2212 z* = 2ib. Since a and b are coprime, that implies that \u03b4 divides 2 = (1 + i)(1 \u2212 i) = i(1 \u2212 i)2. From the formula c2 = zz*, that in turn would imply that c is even, contrary to the hypothesis of a primitive Pythagorean triple. Third, since c2 is a square, every Gaussian prime in its factorization is doubled, i.e., appears an even number of times. Since z and z* share no prime factors, this doubling is also true for them. Hence, z and z* are squares.\nThus, the first factor can be written\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        +\n        b\n        i\n        =\n        \u03b5\n        \n          \n            (\n

The contrapositive completes the proof.\n\n\n== Distribution of triples ==\n\nThere are a number of results on the distribution of Pythagorean triples. In the scatter plot, a number of obvious patterns are already apparent. Whenever the legs (a,b) of a primitive triple appear in the plot, all integer multiples of (a,b) must also appear in the plot, and this property produces the appearance of lines radiating from the origin in the diagram.\nWithin the scatter, there are sets of parabolic patterns with a high density of points and all their foci at the origin, opening up in all four directions. Different parabolas intersect at the axes and appear to reflect off the axis with an incidence angle of 45 degrees, with a third parabola entering in a perpendicular fashion. Within this quadrant, each arc centered on the origin shows that section of the parabola that lies between its tip and its intersection with its semi-latus rectum.\nThese patterns can be explained as follows. If \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        4\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}/4n}\n   is an integer, then (a, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        n\n        \u2212\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        4\n        n\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |n-a^{2}/4n|}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        +\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        4\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n+a^{2}/4n}\n  ) is a Pythagorean triple. (In fact every Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) can be written in this way with integer n, possibly after exchanging a and b, since \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        =\n        (\n        b\n        +\n        c\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n=(b+c)/2}\n   and a and b cannot both be odd.) The Pythagorean triples thus lie on curves given by \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        n\n        \u2212\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        4\n        n\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b=|n-a^{2}/4n|}\n  , that is, parabolas reflected at the a-axis, and the corresponding curves with a and b interchanged. If a is varied for a given n (i.e. on a given parabola), integer values of b occur relatively frequently if n is a square or a small multiple of a square. If several such values happen to lie close together, the corresponding parabolas approximately coincide, and the triples cluster in a narrow parabolic strip. For instance, 382 = 1444, 2 \u00d7 272 = 1458,\n3 \u00d7 222 = 1452, 5 \u00d7 172 = 1445 and 10 \u00d7 122 = 1440; the corresponding parabolic strip around n \u2248 1450 is clearly visible in the scatter plot.\nThe angular properties described above follow immediately from the functional form of the parabolas. The parabolas are reflected at the a-axis at a = 2n, and the derivative of b with respect to a at this point is \u20131; hence the incidence angle is 45\u00b0. Since the clusters, like all triples, are repeated at integer multiples, the value 2n also corresponds to a cluster. The corresponding parabola intersects the b-axis at right angles at b = 2n, and hence its reflection upon interchange of a and b intersects the a-axis at right angles at a = 2n, precisely where the parabola for n is reflected at the a-axis. (The same is of course true for a and b interchanged.)\nAlbert F\u00e4ssler and others provide insights into the significance of these parabolas in the context of conformal mappings.\n\n\n== Special cases and related equations ==\n\n\n=== The Platonic sequence ===\nThe case n = 1 of the more general construction of Pythagorean triples has been known for a long time. Proclus, in his commentary to the 47th Proposition of the first book of Euclid's Elements, describes it as follows:\n\nCertain methods for the discovery of triangles of this kind are handed down, one which they refer to Plato, and another to Pythagoras. (The latter) starts from odd numbers. For it makes the odd number the smaller of the sides about the right angle; then it takes the square of it, subtracts unity and makes half the difference the greater of the sides about the right angle; lastly it adds unity to this and so forms the remaining side, the hypotenuse.\n...For the method of Plato argues from even numbers. It takes the given even number and makes it one of the sides about the right angle; then, bisecting this number and squaring the half, it adds unity to the square to form the hypotenuse, and subtracts unity from the square to form the other side about the right angle. ... Thus it has formed the same triangle that which was obtained by the other method.\nIn equation form, this becomes:\na is odd (Pythagoras, c. 540 BC):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          side \n        \n        a\n        :\n        \n          side \n        \n        b\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                a\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              1\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        :\n        \n          side \n        \n        c\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                a\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              1\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{side }}a:{\\text{side }}b={a^{2}-1 \\over 2}:{\\text{side }}c={a^{2}+1 \\over 2}.}\n  a is even (Plato, c. 380 BC):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          side \n        \n        a\n        :\n        \n          side \n        \n        b\n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                a\n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        1\n        :\n        \n          side \n        \n        c\n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                a\n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{side }}a:{\\text{side }}b=\\left({a \\over 2}\\right)^{2}-1:{\\text{side }}c=\\left({a \\over 2}\\right)^{2}+1}\n  It can be shown that all Pythagorean triples can be obtained, with appropriate rescaling, from the basic Platonic sequence (a, (a2 \u2212 1)/2 and (a2 + 1)/2) by allowing a to take non-integer rational values. If a is replaced with the fraction m/n in the sequence, the result is equal to the 'standard' triple generator (2mn, m2 \u2212 n2,m2 + n2) after rescaling. It follows that every triple has a corresponding rational a value which can be used to generate a similar triangle (one with the same three angles and with sides in the same proportions as the original).  For example, the Platonic equivalent of (56, 33, 65) is generated by a = m/n = 7/4 as (a, (a2 \u20131)/2, (a2+1)/2) = (56/32, 33/32, 65/32). The Platonic sequence itself can be derived by following the steps for 'splitting the square' described in Diophantus II.VIII.\n\n\n=== The Jacobi\u2013Madden equation ===\n\nThe equation,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          c\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          d\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        +\n        c\n        +\n        d\n        \n          )\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}=(a+b+c+d)^{4}}\n  is equivalent to the special Pythagorean triple,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        a\n        b\n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        (\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        c\n        d\n        +\n        \n          d\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        )\n        (\n        c\n        +\n        d\n        )\n        +\n        (\n        c\n        +\n        d\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (a^{2}+ab+b^{2})^{2}+(c^{2}+cd+d^{2})^{2}=((a+b)^{2}+(a+b)(c+d)+(c+d)^{2})^{2}}\n  There is an infinite number of solutions to this equation as solving for the variables involves an elliptic curve.

Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that came to be known as Fermat's Last Theorem because it took longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proved or disproved. The first proof was given by Andrew Wiles in 1994.\n\n\n=== n \u2212 1 or n nth powers summing to an nth power ===\n\nAnother generalization is searching for sequences of n + 1 positive integers for which the nth power of the last is the sum of the nth powers of the previous terms. The smallest sequences for known values of n are:\n\nn = 3: {3, 4, 5; 6}.\nn = 4: {30, 120, 272, 315; 353}\nn = 5: {19, 43, 46, 47, 67; 72}\nn = 7: {127, 258, 266, 413, 430, 439, 525; 568}\nn = 8: {90, 223, 478, 524, 748, 1088, 1190, 1324; 1409}For the n = 3 case, in which \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          w\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}=w^{3},}\n   called the  Fermat cubic, a general formula exists giving all solutions.\nA slightly different generalization allows the sum of (k + 1) nth powers to equal the sum of (n \u2212 k) nth powers. For example:\n\n(n = 3): 13 + 123 = 93 + 103, made famous by Hardy's recollection of a conversation with Ramanujan about the number 1729 being the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of two cubes in two distinct ways.There can also exist n \u2212 1 positive integers whose nth powers sum to an nth power (though, by Fermat's Last Theorem, not for n = 3); these are counterexamples to Euler's sum of powers conjecture.  The smallest known counterexamples are\nn = 4: (95800, 217519, 414560; 422481)\nn = 5: (27, 84, 110, 133; 144)\n\n\n=== Heronian triangle triples ===\n\nA Heronian triangle is commonly defined as one with integer sides whose area is also an integer. The lengths of the sides of such a triangle form a Heronian triple (a, b, c) for a \u2264 b \u2264 c.\nEvery Pythagorean triple is a Heronian triple, because at least one of the legs a, b must be even in a Pythagorean triple, so the area ab/2 is an integer. Not every Heronian triple is a Pythagorean triple, however, as the example (4, 13, 15) with area 24 shows.\nIf (a, b, c) is a Heronian triple, so is (ka, kb, kc) where k is any positive integer; its area will be the integer that is k2 times the integer area of the (a, b, c) triangle.\nThe Heronian triple (a, b, c) is primitive provided a, b, c are setwise coprime.  (With primitive Pythagorean triples the stronger statement that they are pairwise coprime also applies, but with primitive Heronian triangles the stronger statement does not always hold true, such as with (7, 15, 20).) Here are a few of the simplest primitive Heronian triples that are not Pythagorean triples:\n\n(4, 13, 15) with area 24\n(3, 25, 26) with area 36\n(7, 15, 20) with area 42\n(6, 25, 29) with area 60\n(11, 13, 20) with area 66\n(13, 14, 15) with area 84\n(13, 20, 21) with area 126By Heron's formula, the extra condition for a triple of positive integers (a, b, c) with a < b < c to be Heronian is that\n\n(a2 + b2 + c2)2 \u2212 2(a4 + b4 + c4)or equivalently\n\n2(a2b2 + a2c2 + b2c2) \u2212 (a4 + b4 + c4)be a nonzero perfect square divisible by 16.\n\n\n=== Application to cryptography ===\nPrimitive Pythagorean triples have been used in cryptography as random sequences and for the generation of keys.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAlperin, Roger C.

RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol. It was later brought into IEEE 802 and IETF standards.\nRADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP. Network access servers, which control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication. A RADIUS server is usually a background process running on UNIX or Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n== Protocol components ==\nRADIUS is an AAA (authentication, authorization, and accounting) protocol that manages network access. RADIUS uses two types of packets to manage the full AAA process: Access-Request, which manages authentication and authorization; and Accounting-Request, which manages accounting. Authentication and authorization are defined in RFC 2865 while accounting is described by RFC 2866.\n\n\n=== Authentication and authorization ===\nThe user or machine sends a request to a Network Access Server (NAS) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials. The credentials are passed to the NAS device via the link-layer protocol\u2014for example, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) in the case of many dialup or DSL providers or posted in an HTTPS secure web form.\nIn turn, the NAS sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting authorization to grant access via the RADIUS protocol.This request includes access credentials, typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user. Additionally, the request may contain other information which the NAS knows about the user, such as its network address or phone number, and information regarding the user's physical point of attachment to the NAS.\nThe RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as PAP, CHAP or EAP. The user's proof of identification is verified, along with, optionally, other information related to the request, such as the user's network address or phone number, account status, and specific network service access privileges. Historically, RADIUS servers checked the user's information against a locally stored flat file database.  Modern RADIUS servers can do this, or can refer to external sources\u2014commonly SQL, Kerberos, LDAP, or Active Directory servers\u2014to verify the user's credentials.\n\nThe RADIUS server then returns one of three responses to the NAS: 1) Access Reject, 2) Access Challenge, or 3) Access Accept.\n\nAccess Reject\nThe user is unconditionally denied access to all requested network resources. Reasons may include failure to provide proof of identification or an unknown or inactive user account.\nAccess Challenge\nRequests additional information from the user such as a secondary password, PIN, token, or card. Access Challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the Radius Server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the NAS.\nAccess Accept\nThe user is granted access. Once the user is authenticated, the RADIUS server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested.  A given user may be allowed to use a company's wireless network, but not its VPN service, for example. Again, this information may be stored locally on the RADIUS server, or may be looked up in an external source such as LDAP or Active Directory.Each of these three RADIUS responses may include a Reply-Message attribute which may give a reason for the rejection, the prompt for the challenge, or a welcome message for the accept. The text in the attribute can be passed on to the user in a return web page.\nAuthorization attributes are conveyed to the NAS stipulating terms of access to be granted. For example, the following authorization attributes may be included in an Access-Accept:\n\nThe specific IP address to be assigned to the user\nThe address pool from which the user's IP address should be chosen\nThe maximum length of time that the user may remain connected\nAn access list, priority queue or other restrictions on a user's access\nL2TP parameters\nVLAN parameters\nQuality of Service (QoS) parametersWhen a client is configured to use RADIUS, any user of the client presents authentication information to the client. This might be with a customizable login prompt, where the user is expected to enter their username and password. Alternatively, the user might use a link framing protocol such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which has authentication packets which carry this information.\nOnce the client has obtained such information, it may choose to authenticate using RADIUS. To do so, the client creates an \"Access- Request\" containing such Attributes as the user's name, the user's password, the ID of the client and the port ID which the user is accessing. When a password is present, it is hidden using a method based on the RSA Message Digest Algorithm MD5.\n\n\n=== Accounting ===\n\nAccounting is described in RFC 2866.\nWhen network access is granted to the user by the NAS, an Accounting Start (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value \"start\") is sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server to signal the start of the user's network access. \"Start\" records typically contain the user's identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique session identifier.Periodically, Interim Update records (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value \"interim-update\") may be sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server, to update it on the status of an active session. \"Interim\" records typically convey the current session duration and information on current data usage.\nFinally, when the user's network access is closed, the NAS issues a final Accounting Stop record (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value \"stop\") to the RADIUS server, providing information on the final usage in terms of time, packets transferred, data transferred, reason for disconnect and other information related to the user's network access.\nTypically, the client sends Accounting-Request packets until it receives an Accounting-Response acknowledgement, using some retry interval.\nThe primary purpose of this data is that the user can be billed accordingly; the data is also commonly used for statistical purposes and for general network monitoring.\n\n\n== Roaming ==\n\nRADIUS is commonly used to facilitate roaming between ISPs, including by:\n\nCompanies which provide a single global set of credentials that are usable on many public networks;\nIndependent, but collaborating, institutions issuing their own credentials to their own users, that allow a visitor from one to another to be authenticated by their home institution, such as in eduroam.RADIUS facilitates this by the use of realms, which identify where the RADIUS server should forward the AAA requests for processing.\n\n\n=== Realms ===\nA realm is commonly appended to a user's user name and delimited with an '@' sign, resembling an email address domain name. This is known as postfix notation for the realm. Another common usage is prefix notation, which involves prepending the realm to the username and using '\\' as a delimiter.\nModern RADIUS servers allow any character to be used as a realm delimiter, although in practice '@' and '\\' are usually used.\nRealms can also be compounded using both prefix and postfix notation, to allow for complicated roaming scenarios; for example, somedomain.com\\username@anotherdomain.com could be a valid username with two realms.\nAlthough realms often resemble domains, it is important to note that realms are in fact arbitrary text and need not contain real domain names. Realm formats are standardized in RFC 4282, which defines a Network Access Identifier (NAI)  in the form of 'user@realm'. In that specification, the 'realm' portion is required to be a domain name. However, this practice is not always followed.  RFC 7542 replaced RFC 4282 in May 2015.\n\n\n=== Proxy operations ===\nWhen a RADIUS server receives an AAA request for a user name containing a realm, the server will reference a table of configured realms. If the realm is known, the server will then proxy the request to the configured home server for that domain. The behavior of the proxying server regarding the removal of the realm from the request (\"stripping\") is configuration-dependent on most servers. In addition, the proxying server can be configured to add, remove or rewrite AAA requests when they are proxied over time again.\nProxy Chaining is possible in RADIUS and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a NAS Device and a Home server through a series of proxies. Some of advantages of using proxy chains include scalability improvements, policy implementations and capability adjustments. But in roaming scenarios, the NAS, Proxies and Home Server could be typically managed by different administrative entities. Hence, the trust factor among the proxies gains more significance under such Inter-domain applications. Further, the absence of end to end security in RADIUS adds to the criticality of trust among the Proxies involved. Proxy Chains are explained in RFC 2607.\n\n\n=== Security ===\nRoaming with RADIUS exposes the users to various security and privacy concerns. More generally, some roaming partners establish a secure tunnel between the RADIUS servers to ensure that users' credentials cannot be intercepted while being proxied across the internet. This is a concern as the MD5 hash built into RADIUS is considered insecure.\n\n\n== Packet structure ==\n\nRADIUS is transported over UDP/IP on ports 1812 and 1813.The RADIUS packet data format is shown to the right. The fields are transmitted from left to right, starting with the code, the identifier, the length, the authenticator and the attributes.\nAssigned RADIUS Codes (decimal) include the following:\nThe Identifier field aids in matching requests and replies.\nThe Length field indicates the length of the entire RADIUS packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator and optional Attribute fields.\nThe Authenticator is used to authenticate the reply from the RADIUS server, and is used in encrypting passwords; its length is 16 bytes.\n\n\n=== Attribute value pairs ===\n\nThe RADIUS Attribute Value Pairs (AVP) carry data in both the request and the response for the authentication, authorization, and accounting transactions. The length of the radius packet is used to determine the end of the AVPs.\n\n\n== Vendor-specific attributes ==\nRADIUS is extensible; many vendors of RADIUS hardware and software implement their own variants using Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs). Microsoft has published some of their VSAs. VSA definitions from many other companies remain proprietary and/or ad hoc, nonetheless many VSA dictionaries can be found by downloading the source code of open source RADIUS implementations, for example FreeRADIUS.\nRFC 2865 provide basic encoding that attribute should follow, within the description value of Vendor Length field is not explicit but should be understood within a attribute-value context. This Vendor Length is length of Value in byte plus 2 bytes, those two byte counts for Vendor Type and Vendor Length. The number of octets for encoding Vendor Type and Vendor Length is implementation specific, and some vendors use 2 octets for type, length, or both. Specific values are determined by using format=2,2 keyword in the freeradius dictionary.\nVendor-Specific attributes follows this encoding which is used by freeradius implementation using vendor specific dictionaries.\n\n\n== Security ==\nThe RADIUS protocol transmits obfuscated passwords using a shared secret and the MD5 hashing algorithm. As this particular implementation provides only weak protection of the user's credentials, additional protection, such as IPsec tunnels or physically secured data-center networks, should be used to further protect the RADIUS traffic between the NAS device and the RADIUS server. Additionally, the user's security credentials are the only part protected by RADIUS itself, yet other user-specific attributes such as tunnel-group IDs or VLAN memberships passed over RADIUS may be considered sensitive (helpful to an attacker) or private (sufficient to identify the individual client) information as well. The RadSec protocol claims to solve aforementioned security issues.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs more dial-up customers used the NSFNET a request for proposal was sent out by Merit Network in 1991 to consolidate their various proprietary authentication, authorization and accounting systems. Among the early respondents was Livingston Enterprises and an early version of the RADIUS was written after a meeting. The early RADIUS server was installed on a UNIX operating system. Livingston Enterprises was acquired by Lucent and together with Merit steps were taken to gain industry acceptance for RADIUS as a protocol. Both companies offered a RADIUS server at no charge. In 1997 RADIUS was published as RFC 2058 and RFC 2059, current versions are RFC 2865 and RFC 2866.The original RADIUS standard specified that RADIUS is stateless and should run over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). For authentication it was envisaged that RADIUS should support the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) over the Point-to-Point Protocol. Passwords are hidden by taking the MD5 hash of the packet and a shared secret, and then XORing that hash with the password. The original RADIUS also provided more than 50 attribute-value pairs, with the possibility for vendors to configure their own pairs.The choice of the hop-by-hop security model, rather than end-to-end encryption, meant that if several proxy RADIUS servers are in use, every server must examine, perform logic on and pass on all data in a request. This exposes data such as passwords and certificates at every hop. RADIUS servers also did not have the ability to stop access to resources once an authorisation had been issued. Subsequent standards such as RFC 3576 and its successor RFC 5176 allowed for RADIUS servers to dynamically change a users authorization, or to disconnect a user entirely.Now, several commercial and open-source RADIUS servers exist. Features can vary, but most can look up the users in text files, LDAP servers, various databases, etc. Accounting records can be written to text files, various databases, forwarded to external servers, etc. SNMP is often used for remote monitoring and keep-alive checking of a RADIUS server. RADIUS proxy servers are used for centralized administration and can rewrite RADIUS packets on the fly for security reasons, or to convert between vendor dialects.\nThe Diameter protocol was intended as the replacement for RADIUS. While both are Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols, the use-cases for the two protocols have since diverged. Diameter is largely used in the 3G space. RADIUS is used elsewhere. One of the largest barriers to having Diameter replace RADIUS is that switches and Access Points typically implement RADIUS, but not Diameter. Diameter uses SCTP or TCP while RADIUS typically uses UDP as the transport layer.  As of 2012, RADIUS can also use TCP as the transport layer with TLS for security.\n\n\n== Standards documentation ==\nThe RADIUS protocol is currently defined in the following IETF RFC documents.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language\nTACACS\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHassell, Jonathan (2002).

Thus, lines are one-dimensional objects, though they may exist embedded in two, three, or higher dimension spaces. The word line may also refer to a line segment in everyday life, which has two points to denote its ends (endpoints). A line can be referred to by two points that lie on it (e.g. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              B\n            \n            \u2194\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\overleftrightarrow {AB}}}\n  ) or by a single letter (e.g. \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2113\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n  ).\nEuclid described a line as \"breadthless length\" which \"lies evenly with respect to the points on itself\"; he introduced several postulates as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed all of geometry. Euclidean line and Euclidean geometry are terms introduced to avoid confusion with generalizations introduced since the end of the 19th century, such as non-Euclidean, projective and affine geometry.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nWhen geometry was first formalised by Euclid in the Elements, he defined a general line (now called a curve) to be \"breadthless length\" with a straight line being a line \"which lies evenly with the points on itself\".:\u200a291\u200a These definitions serve little purpose, since they use terms which are not by themselves defined. In fact, Euclid himself did not use these definitions in this work, and probably included them just to make it clear to the reader what was being discussed. In modern geometry, a line is simply taken as an undefined object with properties given by axioms,:\u200a95\u200a but is sometimes defined as a set of points obeying a linear relationship when some other fundamental concept is left undefined.\nIn an axiomatic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of Hilbert (Euclid's original axioms contained various flaws which have been corrected by modern mathematicians),:\u200a108\u200a a line is stated to have certain properties which relate it to other lines and points. For example, for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them, and any two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.:\u200a300\u200a In two dimensions (i.e., the Euclidean plane), two lines which do not intersect are called parallel. In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are parallel if they are contained in a plane, or skew if they are not.\nOn a Euclidean plane, a line can be represented as a boundary between two regions.:\u200a104\u200a Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into convex polygons (possibly unbounded); this partition is known as an arrangement of lines.\n\n\n=== In higher dimensions ===\nIn three-dimensional space, a first degree equation in the variables x, y, and z defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they give rise to are not parallel, define a line which is the intersection of the planes. More generally, in n-dimensional space n\u22121 first-degree equations in the n coordinate variables define a line under suitable conditions.\nIn more general Euclidean space, Rn (and analogously in every other affine space), the line L passing through two different points a and b  is the subset\n\nThe direction of the line is from a (t = 0) to b (t = 1), or in other words, in the direction of the vector b \u2212 a. Different choices of a and b can yield the same line.\n\n\n==== Collinear points ====\n\nThree points are said to be collinear if they lie on the same line. Three points usually determine a plane, but in the case of three collinear points this does not happen.\nIn affine coordinates, in n-dimensional space the points X = (x1, x2, ..., xn), Y = (y1, y2, ..., yn), and Z = (z1, z2, ..., zn) are collinear if the matrix\n\nhas a rank less than 3. In particular, for three points in the plane (n = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its determinant is zero.\nEquivalently for three points in a plane, the points are collinear if and only if the slope between one pair of points equals the slope between any other pair of points (in which case the slope between the remaining pair of points will equal the other slopes). By extension, k points in a plane are collinear if and only if any (k\u20131) pairs of points have the same pairwise slopes.\nIn Euclidean geometry, the Euclidean distance d(a,b) between two points a and b may be used to express the collinearity between three points by:\nThe points a, b and c are collinear if and only if d(x,a) = d(c,a) and d(x,b) = d(c,b) implies x = c.However, there are other notions of distance (such as the Manhattan distance) for which this property is not true.\nIn the geometries where the concept of a line is a primitive notion, as may be the case in some synthetic geometries, other methods of determining collinearity are needed.\n\n\n=== Types ===\n\nIn a sense, all lines in Euclidean geometry are equal, in that, without coordinates, one can not tell them apart from one another. However, lines may play special roles with respect to other objects in the geometry and be divided into types according to that relationship. For instance, with respect to a conic (a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola), lines can be:\n\ntangent lines, which touch the conic at a single point;\nsecant lines, which intersect the conic at two points and pass through its interior;\nexterior lines, which do not meet the conic at any point of the Euclidean plane; or\na directrix, whose distance from a point helps to establish whether the point is on the conic.In the context of determining parallelism in Euclidean geometry, a transversal is a line that intersects two other lines that may or not be parallel to each other.\nFor more general algebraic curves, lines could also be:\n\ni-secant lines, meeting the curve in i points counted without multiplicity, or\nasymptotes, which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching it.With respect to triangles we have:\n\nthe Euler line,\nthe Simson lines, and\ncentral lines.For a convex quadrilateral with at most two parallel sides, the Newton line is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals.For a hexagon with vertices lying on a conic we have the Pascal line and, in the special case where the conic is a pair of lines, we have the Pappus line.\nParallel lines are lines in the same plane that never cross. Intersecting lines share a single point in common. Coincidental lines coincide with each other\u2014every point that is on either one of them is also on the other.\nPerpendicular lines are lines that intersect at right angles.In three-dimensional space, skew lines are lines that are not in the same plane and thus do not intersect each other.\n\n\n=== In axiomatic systems ===\nThe concept of line is often considered in geometry as a primitive notion in axiomatic systems,:\u200a95\u200a meaning it is not being defined by other concepts. In those situations where a line is a defined concept, as in coordinate geometry, some other fundamental ideas are taken as primitives. When the line concept is a primitive, the behaviour and properties of lines are dictated by the axioms which they must satisfy.In a non-axiomatic or simplified axiomatic treatment of geometry, the concept of a primitive notion may be too abstract to be dealt with. In this circumstance, it is possible to provide a description or mental image of a primitive notion, to give a foundation to build the notion on which would formally be based on the (unstated) axioms. Descriptions of this type may be referred to, by some authors, as definitions in this informal style of presentation. These are not true definitions, and could not be used in formal proofs of statements. The \"definition\" of line in Euclid's Elements falls into this category.:\u200a95\u200a Even in the case where a specific geometry is being considered (for example, Euclidean geometry), there is no generally accepted agreement among authors as to what an informal description of a line should be when the subject is not being treated formally.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\n\n=== Linear equation ===\n\nLines in a Cartesian plane or, more generally, in affine coordinates, are characterized by linear equations. More precisely, every line \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n   (including vertical lines) is the set of all points whose coordinates (x, y) satisfy a linear equation; that is,\n\nwhere a, b and c are fixed real numbers (called coefficients) such that a and b are not both zero. Using this form, vertical lines correspond to equations with b = 0.\nOne can further suppose either c = 1 or c = 0, by dividing everything by c if it is not zero.\nThere are many variant ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. The above form is sometimes called the standard form. If the constant term is put on the left, the equation becomes\n\nand this is sometimes called the general form of the equation. However, this terminology is not universally accepted, and many authors do not distinguish these two forms.\nThese forms are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, x-intercept, known points on the line and y-intercept.\nThe equation of the line passing through two different points \n  \n    \n      \n        \n

functions of the independent variable t which ranges over the real numbers.\n(x0, y0, z0) is any point on the line.\na, b, and c are related to the slope of the line, such that the direction vector (a, b, c) is parallel to the line.Parametric equations for lines in higher dimensions are similar in that they are based on the specification of one point on the line and a direction vector.\nAs a

For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.\nWhen a geometry is described by a set of axioms, the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called primitive object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry. Thus in differential geometry, a line may be interpreted as a geodesic (shortest path between points), while in some projective geometries, a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line.\n\n\n=== Projective geometry ===\n\nIn many models of projective geometry, the representation of a line rarely conforms to the notion of the \"straight curve\" as it is visualised in Euclidean geometry. In elliptic geometry we see a typical example of this.:\u200a108\u200a In the spherical representation of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by great circles of a sphere with diametrically opposite points identified. In a different model of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by Euclidean planes passing through the origin. Even though these representations are visually distinct, they satisfy all the properties (such as, two points determining a unique line) that make them suitable representations for lines in this geometry.\nThe \"shortness\" and \"straightness\" of a line, interpreted as the property that the distance along the line between any two of its points is minimized (see triangle inequality), can be generalized and leads to the concept of geodesics in metric spaces.\n\n\n== Extensions ==\n\n\n=== Ray ===\n\nGiven a line and any point A on it, we may consider A as decomposing this line into two parts.\nEach such part is called a ray and the point A is called its initial point. It is also known as half-line, a one-dimensional half-space. The point A is considered to be a member of the ray. Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through A and proceeding indefinitely, starting at A, in one direction only along the line. However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.\nGiven distinct points A and B, they determine a unique ray with initial point A. As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between A and B (including A and B) and all the points C on the line through A and B such that B is between A and C. This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points C on the line determined by A and B such that A is not between B and C. A point D, on the line determined by A and B but not in the ray with initial point A determined by B, will determine another ray with initial point A. With respect to the AB ray, the AD ray is called the opposite ray.\nThus, we would say that two different points, A and B, define a line and a decomposition of this line into the disjoint union of an open segment (A,\u2009B) and two rays, BC and AD (the point D is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of A on the line AB). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.\nIn Euclidean geometry two rays with a common endpoint form an angle.The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically Euclidean geometry or affine geometry over an ordered field. On the other hand, rays do not exist in projective geometry nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the complex numbers or any finite field.\n\n\n=== Line segment ===\n\nA line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points. Depending on how the line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment. Two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew, but unlike lines they may be none of these, if they are coplanar and either do not intersect or are collinear.\n\n\n=== Number line ===\n\nA point on number line corresponds to a real number and vice versa. Usually, integers are evenly spaced on the line, with positive numbers are on the right, negative numbers on the left. As an extension to the concept, an imaginary line representing imaginary numbers can be drawn perpendicular to the number line at zero. The two lines forms the complex plane, a geometrical representation of the set of complex numbers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAffine transformation\nCurve\nDistance between two parallel lines\nDistance from a point to a line\nIncidence (geometry)\nLine segment\nGeneralised circle\nLocus\nPlane (geometry)\nPolyline\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Line (curve)\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nEquations of the Straight Line at Cut-the-Knot", "Two-dimensional_space": "In mathematics, a plane is a two-dimensional space or flat surface that extends indefinitely. \nA plane is the two-dimensional analogue of a point (zero dimensions), a line (one dimension) and three-dimensional space. \nWhen working exclusively in two-dimensional Euclidean space, the definite article is used, so the Euclidean plane refers to the whole space. \nMany fundamental tasks in mathematics, geometry, trigonometry, graph theory, and graphing are performed in a two-dimensional or planar space.\n\n\n== Euclidean plane ==\n\n\n=== Embedding in three-dimensional space ===\n\n\n== Elliptic plane ==\n\n\n== Projective plane ==\n\n\n== Further generalizations ==\nIn addition to its familiar geometric structure, with isomorphisms that are isometries with respect to the usual inner product, the plane may be viewed at various other levels of abstraction. Each level of abstraction corresponds to a specific category.\nAt one extreme, all geometrical and metric concepts may be dropped to leave the topological plane, which may be thought of as an idealized homotopically trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct surfaces (or 2-manifolds) classified in low-dimensional topology. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all continuous bijections. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of graph theory that deals with planar graphs, and results such as the four color theorem.\nThe plane may also be viewed as an affine space, whose isomorphisms are combinations of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but collinearity and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.\nDifferential geometry views a plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold, a topological plane which is provided with a differential structure. Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but there is now a concept of smoothness of maps, for example a differentiable or smooth path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.\nIn the opposite direction of abstraction, we may apply a compatible field structure to the geometric plane, giving rise to the complex plane and the major area of complex analysis. The complex field has only two isomorphisms that leave the real line fixed, the identity and conjugation.\nIn the same way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, one-dimensional (over the complex numbers) complex manifold, sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all conformal bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.\nIn addition, the Euclidean geometry (which has zero curvature everywhere) is not the only geometry that the plane may have. The plane may be given a spherical geometry by using the stereographic projection. This can be thought of as placing a sphere tangent to the plane (just like a ball on the floor), removing the top point, and projecting the sphere onto the plane from this point. This is one of the projections that may be used in making a flat map of part of the Earth's surface. The resulting geometry has constant positive curvature.\nAlternatively, the plane can also be given a metric which gives it constant negative curvature giving the hyperbolic plane. The latter possibility finds an application in the theory of special relativity in the simplified case where there are two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. (The hyperbolic plane is a timelike hypersurface in three-dimensional Minkowski space.)\n\n\n== Topological and differential geometric notions ==\nThe one-point compactification of the plane is homeomorphic to a sphere (see stereographic projection); the open disk is homeomorphic to a sphere with the \"north pole\" missing; adding that point completes the (compact) sphere. The result of this compactification is a manifold referred to as the Riemann sphere or the complex projective line. The projection from the Euclidean plane to a sphere without a point is a diffeomorphism and even a conformal map.\nThe plane itself is homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to an open disk. For the hyperbolic plane such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAffine plane\nHyperbolic plane\nGeometric space\n\n\n== References ==", "Dodecagon": "In geometry, a dodecagon, or 12-gon, is any twelve-sided polygon.\n\n\n== Regular dodecagon ==\n\nA regular dodecagon is a  figure with sides of the same length and internal angles of the same size.

The internal angle at each vertex of a regular dodecagon is 150\u00b0.\n\n\n=== Area ===\nThe area of a regular dodecagon of side length a is given by: \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                3\n                cot\n                \u2061\n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \u03c0\n                      12\n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n                \n                  a\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                =\n                3\n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    2\n                    +\n                    \n                      \n                        3\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n                \n                  a\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                \u2243\n                11.19615242\n                \n                \n                  a\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}A&=3\\cot \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{12}}\\right)a^{2}=3\\left(2+{\\sqrt {3}}\\right)a^{2}\\\\&\\simeq 11.19615242\\,a^{2}\\end{aligned}}}\n  And in terms of the apothem r (see also inscribed figure), the area is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                12\n                tan\n                \u2061\n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \u03c0\n                      12\n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n                \n                  r\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                =\n                12\n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    2\n                    \u2212\n                    \n                      \n                        3\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n                \n                  r\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                \u2243\n                3.2153903\n                \n                \n                  r\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}A&=12\\tan \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{12}}\\right)r^{2}=12\\left(2-{\\sqrt {3}}\\right)r^{2}\\\\&\\simeq 3.2153903\\,r^{2}\\end{aligned}}}\n  In terms of the circumradius R, the area is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        6\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n              6\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        3\n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=6\\sin \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{6}}\\right)R^{2}=3R^{2}}\n  The span S of the dodecagon is the distance between two parallel sides and is equal to twice the apothem.

For the regular dodecagon, m=6, and it can be divided into 15: 3 squares, 6 wide 30\u00b0 rhombs and 6 narrow 15\u00b0 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 6-cube, with 15 of 240 faces. The sequence OEIS sequence A006245 defines the number of solutions as 908, including up to 12-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.\n\nOne of the ways the mathematical manipulative pattern blocks are used is in creating a number of different dodecagons. They are related to the rhombic dissections, with 3 60\u00b0 rhombi merged into hexagons, half-hexagon trapezoids, or divided into 2 equilateral triangles.\n\n\n== Symmetry ==\n\nThe regular dodecagon has Dih12 symmetry, order 24. There are 15 distinct subgroup dihedral and cyclic symmetries. Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g12 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.\n\n\n== Occurrence ==\n\n\n=== Tiling ===\nA regular dodecagon can fill a plane vertex with other regular polygons in 4 ways:\n\nHere are 3 example periodic plane tilings that use regular dodecagons, defined by their vertex configuration:\n\n\n== Skew dodecagon ==\n\nA skew dodecagon is a skew polygon with 12 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an dodecagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag dodecagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew dodecagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew dodecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a hexagonal antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20. The dodecagrammic antiprism, s{2,24/5} and dodecagrammic crossed-antiprism, s{2,24/7} also have regular skew dodecagons.\n\n\n=== Petrie polygons ===\nThe regular dodecagon is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, seen as orthogonal projections in Coxeter planes. Examples in 4 dimensions are the 24-cell, snub 24-cell, 6-6 duoprism, 6-6 duopyramid. In 6 dimensions 6-cube, 6-orthoplex, 221, 122. It is also the Petrie polygon for the grand 120-cell and great stellated 120-cell.\n\n\n== Related figures ==\nA dodecagram is a 12-sided star polygon, represented by symbol {12/n}. There is one regular star polygon: {12/5}, using the same vertices, but connecting every fifth point. There are also three compounds: {12/2} is reduced to 2{6} as two hexagons, and {12/3} is reduced to 3{4} as three squares, {12/4} is reduced to 4{3} as four triangles, and {12/6} is reduced to 6{2} as six degenerate digons.\n\nDeeper truncations of the regular dodecagon and dodecagrams can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate star polygon forms with equal spaced vertices and two edge lengths. A truncated hexagon is a dodecagon, t{6}={12}. A quasitruncated hexagon, inverted as {6/5}, is a dodecagram: t{6/5}={12/5}.\n\n\n== Examples in use ==\nIn block capitals, the letters E, H and X (and I in a slab serif font) have dodecagonal outlines. A cross is a dodecagon, as is the logo for the Chevrolet automobile division.\n\nThe regular dodecagon features prominently in many buildings. The Torre del Oro is a dodecagonal military watchtower in Seville, southern Spain, built by the Almohad dynasty. The early thirteenth century Vera Cruz church in Segovia, Spain is dodecagonal. Another example is the Porta di Venere (Venus' Gate), in Spello, Italy, built in the 1st century BC has two dodecagonal towers, called \"Propertius' Towers\".\n\nRegular dodecagonal coins include:\n\nBritish threepenny bit from 1937 to 1971, when it ceased to be legal tender.\nBritish One Pound Coin, introduced in 2017.\nAustralian 50-cent coin\nFijian 50 cents\nTongan 50-seniti, since 1974\nSolomon Islands 50 cents\nCroatian 25 kuna\nRomanian 5000 lei, 2001\u20132005\nCanadian penny, 1982\u20131996\nSouth Vietnamese 20 \u0111\u1ed3ng, 1968\u20131975\nZambian 50 ngwee, 1969\u20131992\nMalawian 50 tambala, 1986\u20131995\nMexican 20 centavos, 1992-2009\n\n\n== See also ==\nDodecagonal number\nDodecahedron \u2013 any polyhedron with 12 faces.\nDodecagram\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Dodecagon\". MathWorld.\nK\u00fcrschak's Tile and Theorem\nDefinition and properties of a dodecagon With interactive animation\nThe regular dodecagon in the classroom, using pattern blocks", "Chord_(geometry)": "A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circular arc. If a chord were to be extended infinitely on both directions into a line, the object is a secant line. More generally, a chord is a line segment joining two points on any curve, for instance, an ellipse. A chord that passes through a circle's center point is the circle's diameter. \nThe word chord is from the Latin chorda meaning bowstring.\n\n\n== In circles ==\n\nAmong properties of chords of a circle are the following:\n\nChords are equidistant from the center if and only if their lengths are equal.\nEqual chords are subtended by equal angles from the center of the circle.\nA chord that passes through the center of a circle is called a diameter and is the longest chord of that specific circle.\nIf the line extensions (secant lines) of chords AB and CD intersect at a point P, then their lengths satisfy AP\u00b7PB = CP\u00b7PD (power of a point theorem).\n\n\n== In conics ==\nThe midpoints of a set of parallel chords of a conic are collinear (midpoint theorem for conics).\n\n\n== In trigonometry ==\n\nChords were used extensively in the early development of trigonometry. The first known trigonometric table, compiled by Hipparchus, tabulated the value of the chord function for every 7+1/2 degrees.  In the second century AD, Ptolemy of Alexandria compiled a more extensive table of chords in his book on astronomy, giving the value of the chord for angles ranging from 1/2 to 180 degrees by increments of 1/2 degree.  The circle was of diameter 120, and the chord lengths are accurate to two base-60 digits after the integer part.The chord function is defined geometrically as shown in the picture. The chord of an angle is the length of the chord between two points on a unit circle separated by that central angle. The angle \u03b8 is taken in the positive sense and must lie in the interval 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0 (radian measure). The chord function can be related to the modern sine function, by taking one of the points to be (1,0), and the other point to be (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8), and then using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the chord length:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        crd\n        \u2061\n         \n        \u03b8\n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            1\n            \u2212\n            cos\n            \u2061\n            \u03b8\n            \n              )\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              sin\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \u2061\n            \u03b8\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            2\n            \u2212\n            2\n            cos\n            \u2061\n            \u03b8\n          \n        \n        =\n        2\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {crd} \\ \\theta ={\\sqrt {(1-\\cos \\theta )^{2}+\\sin ^{2}\\theta }}={\\sqrt {2-2\\cos \\theta }}=2\\sin \\left({\\frac {\\theta }{2}}\\right).}\n   The last step uses the half-angle formula. Much as modern trigonometry is built on the sine function, ancient trigonometry was built on the chord function. Hipparchus is purported to have written a twelve-volume work on chords, all now lost, so presumably, a great deal was known about them. In the table below (where c is the chord length, and D the diameter of the circle) the chord function can be shown to satisfy many identities analogous to well-known modern ones:\n\nThe inverse function exists as well:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        =\n        2\n        arcsin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            c\n            \n              2\n              r\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta =2\\arcsin {\\frac {c}{2r}}}\n  \n\n\n== See also ==\nCircular segment - the part of the sector that remains after removing the triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the circular arc on the boundary.\nScale of chords\nPtolemy's table of chords\nHolditch's theorem, for a chord rotating in a convex closed curve\nCircle graph\nExsecant and excosecant\nVersine and haversine\nZindler curve (closed and simple curve in which all chords that divide the arc length into halves have the same length)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHistory of Trigonometry Outline\nTrigonometric functions Archived 2017-03-10 at the Wayback Machine, focusing on history\nChord (of a circle) With interactive animation", "Symmetry": "Symmetry (from Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 symmetria \"agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement\") in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance. In mathematics, \"symmetry\" has a more precise definition, and is usually used to refer to an object that is invariant under some transformations; including translation, reflection, rotation or scaling. Although these two meanings of \"symmetry\" can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article.\nMathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, including theoretic models, language, and music.This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in mathematics, including geometry, the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in science and nature; and in the arts, covering architecture, art and music.\nThe opposite of symmetry is asymmetry, which refers to the absence or a violation of symmetry.\n\n\n== In mathematics ==\n\n\n=== In geometry ===\n\nA geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion. This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object, but doesn't change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation:\n\nAn object has reflectional symmetry (line or mirror symmetry) if there is a line (or in 3D a plane) going through it which divides it into two pieces that are mirror images of each other.\nAn object has rotational symmetry if the object can be rotated about a fixed point (or in 3D about a line) without changing the overall shape.\nAn object has translational symmetry if it can be translated (moving every point of the object by the same distance) without changing its overall shape.\nAn object has helical symmetry if it can be simultaneously translated and rotated in three-dimensional space along a line known as a screw axis.\nAn object has scale symmetry if it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted. Fractals also exhibit a form of scale symmetry, where smaller portions of the fractal are similar in shape to larger portions.\nOther symmetries include glide reflection symmetry (a reflection followed by a translation) and rotoreflection symmetry (a combination of a rotation and a reflection).\n\n\n=== In logic ===\nA dyadic relation R = S \u00d7 S is symmetric if for all elements a, b in S, whenever it is true that Rab, it is also true that Rba. Thus, the relation \"is the same age as\" is symmetric, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul.\nIn propositional logic, symmetric binary logical connectives include and (\u2227, or &), or (\u2228, or |) and if and only if (\u2194), while the connective if (\u2192) is not symmetric. Other symmetric logical connectives include nand (not-and, or \u22bc), xor (not-biconditional, or \u22bb), and nor (not-or, or \u22bd).\n\n\n=== Other areas of mathematics ===\n\nGeneralizing from geometrical symmetry in the previous section, one can say that a mathematical object is symmetric with respect to a given mathematical operation, if, when applied to the object, this operation preserves some property of the object. The set of operations that preserve a given property of the object form a group.\nIn general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry. Examples include even and odd functions in calculus, symmetric groups in abstract algebra, symmetric matrices in linear algebra, and Galois groups in Galois theory. In statistics, symmetry also manifests as symmetric probability distributions, and as skewness\u2014the asymmetry of distributions.\n\n\n== In science and nature ==\n\n\n=== In physics ===\n\nSymmetry in physics has been generalized to mean invariance\u2014that is, lack of change\u2014under any kind of transformation, for example arbitrary coordinate transformations. This concept has become one of the most powerful tools of theoretical physics, as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this role inspired the Nobel laureate PW Anderson to write in his widely read 1972 article More is Different that \"it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry.\" See Noether's theorem (which, in greatly simplified form, states that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity such as energy or momentum; a conserved current, in Noether's original language); and also, Wigner's classification, which says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature.Important symmetries in physics include continuous symmetries and discrete symmetries of spacetime; internal symmetries of particles; and supersymmetry of physical theories.\n\n\n=== In biology ===\n\nIn biology, the notion of symmetry is mostly used explicitly to describe body shapes. Bilateral animals, including humans, are more or less symmetric with respect to the sagittal plane which divides the body into left and right halves. Animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialized with a mouth and sense organs, and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric for the purpose of movement, with symmetrical pairs of muscles and skeletal elements, though internal organs often remain asymmetric.Plants and sessile (attached) animals such as sea anemones often have radial or rotational symmetry, which suits them because food or threats may arrive from any direction. Fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.In biology, the notion of symmetry is also used as in physics, that is to say to describe the properties of the objects studied, including their interactions. A remarkable property of biological evolution is the changes of symmetry corresponding to the appearance of new parts and dynamics.\n\n\n=== In chemistry ===\n\nSymmetry is important to chemistry because it undergirds essentially all specific interactions between molecules in nature (i.e.,  via the interaction of natural and human-made chiral molecules with inherently chiral biological systems). The control of the symmetry of molecules produced in modern chemical synthesis contributes to the ability of scientists to offer therapeutic interventions with minimal side effects. A rigorous understanding of symmetry explains fundamental observations in quantum chemistry, and in the applied areas of spectroscopy and crystallography. The theory and application of symmetry to these areas of physical science draws heavily on the mathematical area of group theory.\n\n\n=== In psychology and neuroscience ===\n\nFor a human observer, some symmetry types are more salient than others, in particular the most salient is a reflection with a vertical axis, like that present in the human face. Ernst Mach made this observation in his book \"The analysis of sensations\" (1897), and this implies that perception of symmetry is not a general response to all types of regularities. Both behavioural and neurophysiological studies have confirmed the special sensitivity to reflection symmetry in humans and also in other animals. Early studies within the Gestalt tradition suggested that bilateral symmetry was one of the key factors in perceptual grouping. This is known as the Law of Symmetry. The role of symmetry in grouping and figure/ground organization has been confirmed in many studies. For instance, detection of reflectional symmetry is faster when this is a property of a single object. Studies of human perception and psychophysics have shown that detection of symmetry is fast, efficient and robust to perturbations. For example, symmetry can be detected with presentations between 100 and 150 milliseconds.More recent neuroimaging studies have documented which brain regions are active during perception of symmetry. Sasaki et al. used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare responses for patterns with symmetrical or random dots. A strong activity was present in extrastriate regions of the occipital cortex but not in the primary visual cortex. The extrastriate regions included V3A, V4, V7, and the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Electrophysiological studies have found a late posterior negativity that originates from the same areas. In general, a large part of the visual system seems to be involved in processing visual symmetry, and these areas involve similar networks to those responsible for detecting and recognising objects.\n\n\n== In social interactions ==\nPeople observe the symmetrical nature, often including asymmetrical balance, of social interactions in a variety of contexts. These include assessments of reciprocity, empathy, sympathy, apology, dialogue, respect, justice, and revenge.\nReflective equilibrium is the balance that may be attained through deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and specific judgments.\nSymmetrical interactions send the moral message \"we are all the same\" while asymmetrical interactions may send the message \"I am special; better than you.\" Peer relationships, such as can be governed by the golden rule, are based on symmetry, whereas power relationships are based on asymmetry. Symmetrical relationships can to some degree be maintained by simple (game theory) strategies seen in symmetric games such as tit for tat.\n\n\n== In the arts ==\n\nThere exists a list of journals and newsletters known to deal, at least in part, with symmetry and the arts.\n\n\n=== In architecture ===\n\nSymmetry finds its ways into architecture at every scale, from the overall external views of buildings such as Gothic cathedrals and The White House, through the layout of the individual floor plans, and down to the design of individual building elements such as tile mosaics. Islamic buildings such as the Taj Mahal and the Lotfollah mosque make elaborate use of symmetry both in their structure and in their ornamentation. Moorish buildings like the Alhambra are ornamented with complex patterns made using translational and reflection symmetries as well as rotations.It has been said that only bad architects rely on a \"symmetrical layout of blocks, masses and structures\"; Modernist architecture, starting with International style, relies instead on \"wings and balance of masses\".\n\n\n=== In pottery and metal vessels ===\n\nSince the earliest uses of pottery wheels to help shape clay vessels, pottery has had a strong relationship to symmetry. Pottery created using a wheel acquires full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point, potters from ancient times onwards have added patterns that modify the rotational symmetry to achieve visual objectives.\nCast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient Chinese, for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century BC. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.\n\n\n=== In carpets and rugs ===\n\nA long tradition of the use of symmetry in carpet and rug patterns spans a variety of cultures. American Navajo Indians used bold diagonals and rectangular motifs. Many Oriental rugs have intricate reflected centers and borders that translate a pattern. Not surprisingly, rectangular rugs have typically the symmetries of a rectangle\u2014that is, motifs that are reflected across both the horizontal and vertical axes (see Klein four-group \u00a7 Geometry).\n\n\n=== In quilts ===\n\nAs quilts are made from square blocks (usually 9, 16, or 25 pieces to a block) with each smaller piece usually consisting of fabric triangles, the craft lends itself readily to the application of symmetry.\n\n\n=== In other arts and crafts ===\n \n\nSymmetries appear in the design of objects of all kinds. Examples include beadwork, furniture, sand paintings, knotwork, masks, and musical instruments. Symmetries are central to the art of M.C. Escher and the many applications of tessellation in art and craft forms such as wallpaper, ceramic tilework such as in Islamic geometric decoration, batik, ikat, carpet-making, and many kinds of textile and embroidery patterns.Symmetry is also used in designing logos. By creating a logo on a grid and using the theory of symmetry, designers can organize their work, create a symmetric or asymmetrical design, determine the space between letters, determine how much negative space is required in the design, and how to accentuate parts of the logo to make it stand out.\n\n\n=== In music ===\n\nSymmetry is not restricted to the visual arts. Its role in the history of music touches many aspects of the creation and perception of music.\n\n\n==== Musical form ====\nSymmetry has been used as a formal constraint by many composers, such as the arch (swell) form (ABCBA) used by Steve Reich, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, and James Tenney. In classical music, Bach used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance.\n\n\n==== Pitch structures ====\nSymmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of scales and chords, traditional or tonal music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of pitches, such as the diatonic scale or the major chord. Symmetrical scales or chords, such as the whole tone scale, augmented chord, or diminished seventh chord (diminished-diminished seventh), are said to lack direction or a sense of forward motion, are ambiguous as to the key or tonal center, and have a less specific diatonic functionality. However, composers such as Alban Berg, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, and George Perle have used axes of symmetry and/or interval cycles in an analogous way to keys or non-tonal tonal centers. George Perle explains \"C\u2013E, D\u2013F\u266f, [and] Eb\u2013G, are different instances of the same interval \u2026 the other kind of identity. \u2026 has to do with axes of symmetry. C\u2013E belongs to a family of symmetrically related dyads as follows:\"\nThus in addition to being part of the interval-4 family, C\u2013E is also a part of the sum-4 family (with C equal to 0).\nInterval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven pitch segment of C5 (the cycle of fifths, which are enharmonic with the cycle of fourths) will produce the diatonic major scale. Cyclic tonal progressions in the works of Romantic composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Wagner form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Bart\u00f3k, Alexander Scriabin, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and the Vienna school. At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.The first extended composition consistently based on symmetrical pitch relations was probably Alban Berg's Quartet, Op. 3 (1910).\n\n\n==== Equivalency ====\nTone rows or pitch class sets which are invariant under retrograde are horizontally symmetrical, under inversion vertically. See also Asymmetric rhythm.\n\n\n=== In aesthetics ===\n\nThe relationship of symmetry to aesthetics is complex. Humans find bilateral symmetry in faces physically attractive; it indicates health and genetic fitness. Opposed to this is the tendency for excessive symmetry to be perceived as boring or uninteresting. Rudolf Arnheim suggested that people prefer shapes that have some symmetry, and enough complexity to make them interesting.\n\n\n=== In literature ===\nSymmetry can be found in various forms in literature, a simple example being the palindrome where a brief text reads the same forwards or backwards. Stories may have a symmetrical structure, such as the rise and fall pattern of Beowulf.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Equation That Couldn't Be Solved: How Mathematical Genius Discovered the Language of Symmetry, Mario Livio, Souvenir Press 2006, ISBN 0-285-63743-6\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nInternational Symmetry Association (ISA)\nDutch: Symmetry Around a Point in the Plane Archived 2004-01-02 at the Wayback Machine\nChapman: Aesthetics of Symmetry\nISIS Symmetry\nSymmetry, BBC Radio 4 discussion with Fay Dowker, Marcus du Sautoy & Ian Stewart (In Our Time, Apr. 19, 2007)", "Cylinder_(geometry)": "A cylinder (from Ancient Greek  \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (k\u00falindros) 'roller, tumbler') has traditionally been a three-dimensional solid, one of the most basic of curvilinear geometric shapes. In elementary geometry, it is considered a prism with a circle as its base.\nA cylinder may also be defined as an infinite curvilinear surface in various modern branches of geometry and topology. The shift in the basic meaning\u2014solid versus surface (as in ball and sphere)\u2014has created some ambiguity with terminology. The two concepts may be distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces. In the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the right circular cylinder.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThe definitions and results in this section are taken from the 1913 text Plane and Solid Geometry by George Wentworth and David Eugene Smith (Wentworth & Smith 1913).\nA cylindrical surface is a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Any line in this family of parallel lines is called an element of the cylindrical surface. From a kinematics point of view, given a plane curve, called the directrix, a cylindrical surface is that surface traced out by a line, called the generatrix, not in the plane of the directrix, moving parallel to itself and always passing through the directrix. Any particular position of the generatrix is an element of the cylindrical surface.\n\nA solid bounded by a cylindrical surface and two parallel planes is called a (solid) cylinder. The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an element of the cylinder. All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths. The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a base of the cylinder. The two bases of a cylinder are congruent figures. If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases, the cylinder is a right cylinder, otherwise it is called an oblique cylinder. If the bases are disks (regions whose boundary is a circle) the cylinder is called a circular cylinder. In some elementary treatments, a cylinder always means a circular cylinder.The height (or altitude) of a cylinder is the perpendicular distance between its bases.\nThe cylinder obtained by rotating a line segment about a fixed line that it is parallel to is a cylinder of revolution. A cylinder of revolution is a right circular cylinder. The height of a cylinder of revolution is the length of the generating line segment. The line that the segment is revolved about is called the axis of the cylinder and it passes through the centers of the two bases.\n\n\n=== Right circular cylinders ===\n\nThe bare term cylinder often refers to a solid cylinder with circular ends perpendicular to the axis, that is, a right circular cylinder, as shown in the figure. The cylindrical surface without the ends is called an open cylinder. The formulae for the surface area and the volume of a right circular cylinder have been known from early antiquity.\nA right circular cylinder can also be thought of as the solid of revolution generated by rotating a rectangle about one of its sides. These cylinders are used in an integration technique (the \"disk method\") for obtaining volumes of solids of revolution.A tall and thin needle cylinder has a height much greater than its diameter, whereas a short and wide disk cylinder has a diameter much greater than its height.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Cylindric sections ===\n\nA cylindric section is the intersection of a cylinder's surface with a plane. They are, in general, curves and are special types of plane sections. The cylindric section by a plane that contains two elements of a cylinder is a parallelogram. Such a cylindric section of a right cylinder is a rectangle.A cylindric section in which the intersecting plane intersects and is perpendicular to all the elements of the cylinder is called a right section. If a right section of a cylinder is a circle then the cylinder is a circular cylinder. In more generality, if a right section of a cylinder is a conic section (parabola, ellipse, hyperbola) then the solid cylinder is said to be parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic, respectively.  \n\nFor a right circular cylinder, there are several ways in which planes can meet a cylinder. First, planes that intersect a base in at most one point. A plane is tangent to the cylinder if it meets the cylinder in a single element.  The right sections are circles and all other planes intersect the cylindrical surface in an ellipse. If a plane intersects a base of the cylinder in exactly two points then the line segment joining these points is part of the cylindric section. If such a plane contains two elements, it has a rectangle as a cylindric section, otherwise the sides of the cylindric section are portions of an ellipse. Finally, if a plane contains more than two points of a base, it contains the entire base and the cylindric section is a circle.\nIn the case of a right circular cylinder with a cylindric section that is an ellipse, the eccentricity e of the cylindric section and semi-major axis a of the cylindric section depend on the radius of the cylinder r and the angle \u03b1 between the secant plane and cylinder axis, in the following way:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        e\n        =\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u03b1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e=\\cos \\alpha ,}\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        \n          \n            r\n            \n              sin\n              \u2061\n              \u03b1\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {r}{\\sin \\alpha }}.}\n  \n\n\n=== Volume ===\nIf the base of a circular cylinder has a radius  r and the cylinder has height h, then its volume is given by\n\nV = \u03c0r2h.This formula holds whether or not the cylinder is a right cylinder.This formula may be established by using Cavalieri's principle.\n\nIn more generality, by the same principle, the volume of any cylinder is the product of the area of a base and the height. For example, an elliptic cylinder with a base having semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b and height h has a volume V = Ah, where A is the area of the base ellipse (= \u03c0ab). This result for right elliptic cylinders can also be obtained by integration, where the axis of the cylinder is taken as the positive x-axis and A(x) = A the area of each elliptic cross-section, thus:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            h\n          \n        \n        A\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        d\n        x\n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            h\n          \n        \n        \u03c0\n        a\n        b\n        d\n        x\n        =\n        \u03c0\n        a\n        b\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            h\n          \n        \n        d\n        x\n        =\n        \u03c0\n        a\n        b\n        h\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=\\int _{0}^{h}A(x)dx=\\int _{0}^{h}\\pi abdx=\\pi ab\\int _{0}^{h}dx=\\pi abh.}\n  Using cylindrical coordinates, the volume of a right circular cylinder can be calculated by integration over\n\n  \n    \n      \n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            h\n          \n        \n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            2\n            \u03c0\n          \n        \n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        s\n        \n        \n        d\n        s\n        \n        d\n        \u03d5\n        \n        d\n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle =\\int _{0}^{h}\\int _{0}^{2\\pi }\\int _{0}^{r}s\\,\\,ds\\,d\\phi \\,dz}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        =\n        \u03c0\n        \n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        h\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle =\\pi \\,r^{2}\\,h.}\n  \n\n\n=== Surface area ===\nHaving radius r and altitude (height) h, the surface area of a right circular cylinder, oriented so that its axis is vertical, consists of three parts:\n\nthe area of the top base: \u03c0r2\nthe area of the bottom base: \u03c0r2\nthe area of the side: 2\u03c0rhThe area of the top and bottom bases is the same, and is called the base area, B. The area of the side is known as the lateral area, L.\nAn open cylinder does not include either top or bottom elements, and therefore has surface area (lateral area)\n\nL = 2\u03c0rh.The surface area of the solid right circular cylinder is made up the sum of all three components: top, bottom and side. Its surface area is therefore,\n\nA = L + 2B = 2\u03c0rh + 2\u03c0r2 = 2\u03c0r(h + r) = \u03c0d(r + h),where d = 2r is the diameter of the circular top or bottom.\nFor a given volume, the right circular cylinder with the smallest surface area has h = 2r. Equivalently, for a given surface area, the right circular cylinder with the largest volume has h = 2r, that is, the cylinder fits snugly in a cube of side length = altitude ( = diameter of base circle).The lateral area, L, of a circular cylinder, which need not be a right cylinder, is more generally given by:\n\nL = e \u00d7 p,where e is the length of an element and p is the perimeter of a right section of the cylinder. This produces the previous formula for lateral area when the cylinder is a right circular cylinder.\n\n\n=== Right circular hollow cylinder (cylindrical shell) ===\nA right circular hollow cylinder (or cylindrical shell) is a three-dimensional region bounded by two right circular cylinders having the same axis and two parallel annular bases perpendicular to the cylinders' common axis, as in the diagram.\nLet the height be h, internal radius r, and external radius R.

The sphere has a volume two-thirds that of the circumscribed cylinder and a surface area  two-thirds that of the cylinder (including the bases). Since the values for the cylinder were already known, he obtained, for the first time, the corresponding values for the sphere. The volume of a sphere of radius r is 4/3\u03c0r3 = 2/3 (2\u03c0r3). The surface area of this sphere is 4\u03c0r2 = 2/3 (6\u03c0r2). A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.\n\n\n== Cylindrical surfaces ==\n\nIn some areas of geometry and topology the term cylinder refers to what has been called a cylindrical surface. A cylinder is defined as a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Such cylinders have, at times, been referred to as generalized cylinders. Through each point of a generalized cylinder there passes a unique line that is contained in the cylinder. Thus, this definition may be rephrased to say that a cylinder is any ruled surface spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines.\nA cylinder having a right section that is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola  is called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder and hyperbolic cylinder, respectively. These are degenerate quadric surfaces.\n\nWhen the principal axes of a quadric are aligned with the reference frame (always possible for a quadric), a general equation of the quadric in three dimensions is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        C\n        \n          z\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        D\n        x\n        +\n        E\n        y\n        +\n        G\n        z\n        +\n        H\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cz^{2}+Dx+Ey+Gz+H=0,}\n  with the coefficients being real numbers and not all of A, B and C being 0.

If the cone is a quadratic cone, the plane at infinity (which passes through the vertex) can intersect the cone at two real lines, a single real line (actually a coincident pair of lines), or only at the vertex. These cases give rise to the hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic cylinders respectively.This concept is useful when considering degenerate conics, which may include the cylindrical conics.\n\n\n== Prisms ==\n\nA solid circular cylinder can be seen as the limiting case of a n-gonal prism where n approaches infinity. The connection is very strong and many older texts treat prisms and cylinders simultaneously. Formulas for surface area and volume are derived from the corresponding formulas for prisms by using inscribed and circumscribed prisms and then letting the number of sides of the prism increase without bound. One reason for the early emphasis (and sometimes exclusive treatment) on circular cylinders is that a circular base is the only type of geometric figure for which this technique works with the use of only elementary considerations (no appeal to calculus or more advanced mathematics). Terminology about prisms and cylinders is identical. Thus, for example, since a truncated prism is a prism whose bases do not lie in parallel planes, a solid cylinder whose bases do not lie in parallel planes would be called a truncated cylinder.\nFrom a polyhedral viewpoint, a cylinder can also be seen as a dual of a bicone as an infinite-sided bipyramid.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of shapes\nSteinmetz solid, the intersection of two or three perpendicular cylinders\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAlbert, Abraham Adrian (2016) [1949], Solid Analytic Geometry, Dover, ISBN 978-0-486-81026-3\nSwokowski, Earl W.

MathWorld.\nSurface area of a cylinder at MATHguide\nVolume of a cylinder at MATHguide", "Coordinate_system": "In geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses one or more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of the points or other geometric elements on a manifold such as Euclidean space. The order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in \"the x-coordinate\". The coordinates are taken to be real numbers in elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice versa; this is the basis of analytic geometry.\n\n\n== Common coordinate systems ==\n\n\n=== Number line ===\n\n \nThe simplest example of a coordinate system is the identification of points on a line with real numbers using the number line. In this system, an arbitrary point O (the origin) is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point P is defined as the signed distance from O to P, where the signed distance is the distance taken as positive or negative depending on which side of the line P lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the coordinate of a unique point.\n\n\n=== Cartesian coordinate system ===\n\nThe prototypical example of a coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system. In the plane, two perpendicular lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines.\n\nIn three dimensions, three mutually orthogonal planes are chosen and the three coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes. This can be generalized to create n coordinates for any point in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nDepending on the direction and order of the coordinate axes, the three-dimensional system may be a right-handed or a left-handed system. This is one of many coordinate systems.\n\n\n=== Polar coordinate system ===\n\nAnother common coordinate system for the plane is the polar coordinate system. A point is chosen as the pole and a ray from this point is taken as the polar axis. For a given angle \u03b8, there is a single line through the pole whose angle with the polar axis is \u03b8 (measured counterclockwise from the axis to the line). Then there is a unique point on this line whose signed distance from the origin is r for given number r. For a given pair of coordinates (r, \u03b8) there is a single point, but any point is represented by many pairs of coordinates. For example, (r, \u03b8), (r, \u03b8+2\u03c0) and (\u2212r, \u03b8+\u03c0) are all polar coordinates for the same point. The pole is represented by (0, \u03b8) for any value of \u03b8.\n\n\n=== Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems ===\n\nThere are two common methods for extending the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the cylindrical coordinate system, a z-coordinate with the same meaning as in Cartesian coordinates is added to the r and \u03b8 polar coordinates giving a triple (r, \u03b8, z). Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (r, z) to polar coordinates (\u03c1, \u03c6) giving a triple (\u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6).\n\n\n=== Homogeneous coordinate system ===\n\nA point in the plane may be represented in homogeneous coordinates by a triple (x, y, z) where x/z and y/z are the Cartesian coordinates of the point. This introduces an \"extra\" coordinate since only two are needed to specify a point on the plane, but this system is useful in that it represents any point on the projective plane without the use of infinity. In general, a homogeneous coordinate system is one where only the ratios of the coordinates are significant and not the actual values.\n\n\n=== Other commonly used systems ===\nSome other common coordinate systems are the following:\n\nCurvilinear coordinates are a generalization of coordinate systems generally; the system is based on the intersection of curves.\nOrthogonal coordinates: coordinate surfaces meet at right angles\nSkew coordinates: coordinate surfaces are not orthogonal\nThe log-polar coordinate system represents a point in the plane by the logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a reference line intersecting the origin.\nPl\u00fccker coordinates are a way of representing lines in 3D Euclidean space using a six-tuple of numbers as homogeneous coordinates.\nGeneralized coordinates are used in the Lagrangian treatment of mechanics.\nCanonical coordinates are used in the Hamiltonian treatment of mechanics.\nBarycentric coordinate system as used for ternary plots and more generally in the analysis of triangles.\nTrilinear coordinates are used in the context of triangles.There are ways of describing curves without coordinates, using intrinsic equations that use invariant quantities such as curvature and arc length. These include:\n\nThe Whewell equation relates arc length and the tangential angle.\nThe Ces\u00e0ro equation relates arc length and curvature.\n\n\n== Coordinates of geometric objects ==\nCoordinates systems are often used to specify the position of a point, but they may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines, planes, circles or spheres. For example, Pl\u00fccker coordinates are used to determine the position of a line in space. When there is a need, the type of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system, for example the term line coordinates is used for any coordinate system that specifies the position of a line.\nIt may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a case like this are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.\n\n\n== Transformations ==\n\nThere are often many different possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures. The relationship between different systems is described by coordinate transformations, which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x = r cos\u03b8 and y = r sin\u03b8.\nWith every bijection from the space to itself two coordinate transformations can be associated:\n\nSuch that the new coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the old coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the inverse of those for the coordinate transformation)\nSuch that the old coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the new coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the same as those for the coordinate transformation)For example, in 1D, if the mapping is a translation of 3 to the right, the first moves the origin from 0 to 3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 less, while the second moves the origin from 0 to \u22123, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 more.\n\n\n== Coordinate lines/curves and planes/surfaces ==\n\nIn two dimensions, if one of the coordinates in a point coordinate system is held constant and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting curve is called a coordinate curve. If the coordinate curves are, in fact, straight lines, they may be called coordinate lines. In Cartesian coordinate systems, coordinates lines are mutually orthogonal, and are known as coordinate axes. For other coordinate systems the coordinates curves may be general curves. For example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding r constant are the circles with center at the origin. A coordinate system for which some coordinate curves are not lines is called a curvilinear coordinate system. This procedure does not always make sense, for example there are no coordinate curves in a homogeneous coordinate system.\n\nIn three-dimensional space, if one coordinate is held constant and the other two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate surface. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding \u03c1 constant in the spherical coordinate system are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of coordinate planes.\nSimilarly, coordinate hypersurfaces are the (n \u2212 1)-dimensional spaces resulting from fixing a single coordinate of an n-dimensional coordinate system.\n\n\n== Coordinate maps ==\n\nThe concept of a coordinate map, or coordinate chart is central to the theory of manifolds. A coordinate map is essentially a coordinate system for a subset of a given space with the property that each point has exactly one set of coordinates. More precisely, a coordinate map is a homeomorphism from an open subset of a space X to an open subset of Rn. It is often not possible to provide one consistent coordinate system for an entire space. In this case, a collection of coordinate maps are put together to form an atlas covering the space. A space equipped with such an atlas is called a manifold and additional structure can be defined on a manifold if the structure is consistent where the coordinate maps overlap. For example, a differentiable manifold is a manifold where the change of coordinates from one coordinate map to another is always a differentiable function.\n\n\n== Orientation-based coordinates ==\nIn geometry and kinematics, coordinate systems are used to describe the (linear) position of points and the angular position of axes, planes, and rigid bodies. In the latter case, the orientation of a second (typically referred to as \"local\") coordinate system, fixed to the node, is defined based on the first (typically referred to as \"global\" or \"world\" coordinate system). For instance, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented by an orientation matrix, which includes, in its three columns, the Cartesian coordinates of three points. These points are used to define the orientation of the axes of the local system; they are the tips of three unit vectors aligned with those axes.\n\n\n== Geographic systems ==\n\nThe Earth as a whole is one of the most common geometric spaces requiring the precise measurement of location, and thus coordinate systems. Starting with the Greeks of the Hellenistic period, a variety of coordinate systems have been developed based on the types above, including:\n\nGeographic coordinate system, the spherical coordinates of latitude and longitude\nProjected coordinate systems, including thousands of cartesian coordinate systems, each based on a map projection to create a planar surface of the world or a region.\nGeocentric coordinate system, a three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system that models the earth as an object, and are most commonly used for modeling the orbits of satellites, including the Global Positioning System and other satellite navigation systems.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Relativistic coordinate systems ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHexagonal Coordinate Systems", "Bisection": "In geometry, bisection is the division of something into two equal or congruent parts (having the same shape and size).

bisector divides the angle into two angles with equal measures.  An angle only has one bisector.  Each point of an angle bisector is equidistant from the sides of the angle.\nThe interior or internal bisector of an angle is the line, half-line, or line segment that divides an angle of less than 180\u00b0 into two equal angles.  The exterior or external bisector is the line that divides the supplementary angle (of 180\u00b0 minus the original angle), formed by one side forming the original angle and the extension of the other side, into two equal angles.To bisect an angle with straightedge and compass, one draws a circle whose center is the vertex.  The circle meets the angle at two points: one on each leg.  Using each of these points as a center, draw two circles of the same size.  The intersection of the circles (two points) determines a line that is the angle bisector.\nThe proof of the correctness of this construction is fairly intuitive, relying on the symmetry of the problem. The trisection of an angle (dividing it into three equal parts) cannot be achieved with the compass and ruler alone (this was first proved by Pierre Wantzel).\nThe internal and external bisectors of an angle are perpendicular.

In the latter case the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral.\n\n\n==== Rhombus ====\nEach diagonal of a rhombus bisects opposite angles.\n\n\n==== Ex-tangential quadrilateral ====\nThe excenter of an ex-tangential quadrilateral lies at the intersection of six angle bisectors. These are the internal angle bisectors at two opposite vertex angles, the external angle bisectors (supplementary angle bisectors) at the other two vertex angles, and the external angle bisectors at the angles formed where the extensions of opposite sides intersect.\n\n\n=== Parabola ===\n\nThe tangent to a parabola at any point bisects the angle between the line joining the point to the focus and the line from the point and perpendicular to the directrix.\n\n\n== Bisectors of the sides of a polygon ==\n\n\n=== Triangle ===\n\n\n==== Medians ====\nEach of the three medians of a triangle is a line segment going through one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, so it bisects that side (though not in general perpendicularly). The three medians intersect each other at a point which is called the centroid of the triangle, which is its center of mass if it has uniform density; thus any line through a triangle's centroid and one of its vertices bisects the opposite side. The centroid is twice as close to the midpoint of any one side as it is to the opposite vertex.\n\n\n==== Perpendicular bisectors ====\nThe interior perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the segment, falling entirely on and inside the triangle, of the line that perpendicularly bisects that side. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle's three sides intersect at the circumcenter (the center of the circle through the three vertices). Thus any line through a triangle's circumcenter and perpendicular to a side bisects that side.\nIn an acute triangle the circumcenter divides the interior perpendicular bisectors of the two shortest sides in equal proportions. In an obtuse triangle the two shortest sides' perpendicular bisectors (extended beyond their opposite triangle sides to the circumcenter) are divided by their respective intersecting triangle sides in equal proportions.:\u200aCorollaries 5 and 6\u200aFor any triangle the interior perpendicular bisectors are given by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                a\n                T\n              \n              \n                \n                  a\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                +\n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2212\n                \n                  c\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{a}={\\tfrac {2aT}{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}},}\n   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                b\n                T\n              \n              \n                \n                  a\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                +\n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2212\n                \n                  c\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{b}={\\tfrac {2bT}{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}},}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                c\n                T\n              \n              \n                \n                  a\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2212\n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                +\n                \n                  c\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{c}={\\tfrac {2cT}{a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2}}},}\n   where the sides are \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \u2265\n        b\n        \u2265\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a\\geq b\\geq c}\n   and the area is \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T.}\n  :\u200aThm 2\u200a\n\n\n=== Quadrilateral ===\nThe two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent at a point called the \"vertex centroid\"  and are all bisected by this point.:\u200ap.125\u200aThe four \"maltitudes\" of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter side. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes are concurrent at (all meet at) a common point called the \"anticenter\".\nBrahmagupta's theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always bisects the opposite side.\nThe perpendicular bisector construction forms a quadrilateral from the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of another quadrilateral.\n\n\n== Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors ==\n\n\n=== Triangle ===\nThere is an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid; indeed, they are the only area bisectors that go through the centroid. Three other area bisectors are parallel to the triangle's sides; each of these intersects the other two sides so as to divide them into segments with the proportions \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        :\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}+1:1}\n  . These six lines are concurrent three at a time: in addition to the three medians being concurrent, any one median is concurrent with two of the side-parallel area bisectors.\nThe envelope of the infinitude of area bisectors is a deltoid (broadly defined as a figure with three vertices connected by curves that are concave to the exterior of the deltoid, making the interior points a non-convex set). The vertices of the deltoid are at the midpoints of the medians; all points inside the deltoid are on three different area bisectors, while all points outside it are on just one. [1]\nThe sides of the deltoid are arcs of hyperbolas that are asymptotic to the extended sides of the triangle. The ratio of the area of the envelope of area bisectors to the area of the triangle is invariant for all triangles, and equals \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          log\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        2\n        )\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {3}{4}}\\log _{e}(2)-{\\tfrac {1}{2}},}\n   i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%.\nA cleaver of a triangle is a line segment that bisects the perimeter of the triangle and has one endpoint at the midpoint of one of the three sides. The three cleavers concur at (all pass through) the center of the Spieker circle, which is the incircle of the medial triangle. The cleavers are parallel to the angle bisectors.\nA splitter of a triangle is a line segment having one endpoint at one of the three vertices of the triangle and bisecting the perimeter. The three splitters concur at the Nagel point of the triangle.\nAny line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle. A line through the incenter bisects one of the area or perimeter if and only if it also bisects the other.\n\n\n=== Parallelogram ===\nAny line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area and the perimeter.\n\n\n=== Circle and ellipse ===\nAll area bisectors and perimeter bisectors of a circle or other ellipse go through the center, and any chords through the center bisect the area and perimeter.

MathWorld.This article incorporates material from Angle bisector on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.", "Kite_(geometry)": "In Euclidean geometry, a kite is a quadrilateral with reflection symmetry across a diagonal. Because of this symmetry, a kite has two equal angles and two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides. Kites are also known as deltoids, but the word deltoid may also refer to a deltoid curve, an unrelated geometric object sometimes studied in connection with quadrilaterals. A kite may also be called a dart, particularly if it is not convex.Every kite is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral (its diagonals are at right angles) and, when convex, a tangential quadrilateral (its sides are tangent to an inscribed circle). The convex kites are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both orthodiagonal and tangential. They include as special cases the right kites, with two opposite right angles; the rhombi, with two diagonal axes of symmetry; and the squares, which are also special cases of both right kites and rhombi.\nThe quadrilateral with the greatest ratio of perimeter to diameter is a kite, with 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, and 150\u00b0 angles. Kites of two shapes (one convex and one non-convex) form the prototiles of one of the forms of the Penrose tiling. Kites also form the faces of several face-symmetric polyhedra and tessellations, and have been studied in connection with outer billiards, a problem in the advanced mathematics of dynamical systems.\n\n\n== Definition and classification ==\n\nA kite is a quadrilateral with reflection symmetry across one of its diagonals. Equivalently, it is a quadrilateral whose four sides can be grouped into two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides. A kite can be constructed from the centers and crossing points of any two intersecting circles. Kites as described here may be either convex or concave, although some sources restrict kite to mean only convex kites. A quadrilateral is a kite if and only if any one of the following conditions is true:\n\nThe four sides can be split into two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides.\nOne diagonal crosses the midpoint of the other diagonal at a right angle, forming its perpendicular bisector. (In the concave case, the line through one of the diagonals bisects the other.)\nOne diagonal is a line of symmetry. It divides the quadrilateral into two congruent triangles that are mirror images of each other.\nOne diagonal bisects both of the angles at its two ends.Kite quadrilaterals are named for the wind-blown, flying kites, which often have this shape and which are in turn named for a hovering bird and the sound it makes. According to Olaus Henrici, the name \"kite\" was given to these shapes by James Joseph Sylvester.Quadrilaterals can be classified hierarchically, meaning that some classes of quadrilaterals include other classes, or partitionally, meaning that each quadrilateral is in only one class. Classified hierarchically, kites include the rhombi (quadrilaterals with four equal sides) and squares. All equilateral kites are rhombi, and all equiangular kites are squares. When classified partitionally, rhombi and squares would not be kites, because they belong to a different class of quadrilaterals; similarly, the right kites discussed below would not be kites. The remainder of this article follows a hierarchical classification; rhombi, squares, and right kites are all considered kites. By avoiding the need to consider special cases, this classification can simplify some facts about kites.Like kites, a parallelogram also has two pairs of equal-length sides, but they are opposite to each other rather than adjacent. Any non-self-crossing quadrilateral that has an axis of symmetry must be either a kite, with a diagonal axis of symmetry; or an isosceles trapezoid, with an axis of symmetry through the midpoints of two sides. These include as special cases the rhombus and the rectangle respectively, and the square, which is a special case of both. The self-crossing quadrilaterals include another class of symmetric quadrilaterals, the antiparallelograms.\n\n\n== Special cases ==\n\nThe right kites have two opposite right angles. The right kites are exactly the kites that are cyclic quadrilaterals, meaning that there is a circle that passes through all their vertices. The cyclic quadrilaterals may equivalently defined as the quadrilaterals in which two opposite angles are supplementary (they add to 180\u00b0); if one pair is supplementary the other is as well. Therefore, the right kites are the kites with two opposite supplementary angles, for either of the two opposite pairs of angles. Because right kites circumscribe one circle and are inscribed in another circle, they are bicentric quadrilaterals (actually tricentric, as they also have a third circle externally tangent to the extensions of their sides). If the sizes of an inscribed and a circumscribed circle are fixed, the right kite has the largest area of any quadrilateral trapped between them.Among all quadrilaterals, the shape that has the greatest ratio of its perimeter to its diameter is an equidiagonal kite with angles 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, 150\u00b0, 75\u00b0. Its four vertices lie at the three corners and one of the side midpoints of the Reuleaux triangle. When an equidiagonal kite has side lengths less than or equal to its diagonals, like this one or the square, it is one of the quadrilaterals with the greatest ratio of area to diameter.A kite with three 108\u00b0 angles and one 36\u00b0 angle forms the convex hull of the lute of Pythagoras, a fractal made of nested pentagrams. The four sides of this kite lie on four of the sides of a regular pentagon, with a golden triangle glued onto the fifth side.\n\nThere are only eight polygons that can tile the plane such that reflecting any tile across any one of its edges produces another tile; this arrangement is called an edge tessellation. One of them is a tiling by a right kite, with 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 120\u00b0 angles. It produces the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling (see \u00a7 Tilings and polyhedra). A prototile made by eight of these kites tiles the plane only aperiodically, key to a claimed solution of the einstein problem.In non-Euclidean geometry, a kite can have three right angles and one non-right angle, forming a special case of a Lambert quadrilateral. The fourth angle is acute in hyperbolic geometry and obtuse in spherical geometry.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Diagonals, angles, and area ===\nEvery kite is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral, meaning that its two diagonals are at right angles to each other. Moreover, one of the two diagonals (the symmetry axis) is the perpendicular bisector of the other, and is also the angle bisector of the two angles it meets. Because of its symmetry, the other two angles of the kite must be equal. The diagonal symmetry axis of a convex kite divides it into two congruent triangles; the other diagonal divides it into two isosceles triangles.As is true more generally for any orthodiagonal quadrilateral, the area \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   of a kite may be calculated as half the product of the lengths of the diagonals \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        q\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle q}\n  :\nAlternatively, the area can be calculated by dividing the kite into two congruent triangles and applying the SAS formula for their area.

That is, there exists a circle that is tangent to all four sides. Additionally, if a convex kite is not a rhombus, there is a circle outside the kite that is tangent to the extensions of the four sides; therefore, every convex kite that is not a rhombus is an ex-tangential quadrilateral. The convex kites that are not rhombi are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both tangential and ex-tangential. For every concave kite there exist two circles tangent to two of the sides and the extensions of the other two: one is interior to the kite and touches the two sides opposite from the concave angle, while the other circle is exterior to the kite and touches the kite on the two edges incident to the concave angle.For a convex kite with diagonal lengths \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        q\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle q}\n   and side lengths \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  , the radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n   of the inscribed circle is \nand the radius \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho }\n   of the ex-tangential circle is\nA tangential quadrilateral is also a kite if and only if any one of the following conditions is true:\nThe area is one half the product of the diagonals.\nThe diagonals are perpendicular. (Thus the kites are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both tangential and orthodiagonal.)\nThe two line segments connecting opposite points of tangency have equal length.\nThe tangent lengths, distances from a point of tangency to an adjacent vertex of the quadrilateral, are equal at two opposite vertices of the quadrilateral. (At each vertex, there are two adjacent points of tangency, but they are the same distance as each other from the vertex, so each vertex has a single tangent length.)\nThe two bimedians, line segments connecting midpoints of opposite edges, have equal length.\nThe products of opposite side lengths are equal.\nThe center of the incircle lies on a line of symmetry that is also a diagonal.If the diagonals in a tangential quadrilateral \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABCD}\n   intersect at \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  , and the incircles of triangles \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABP}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        C\n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle BCP}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        D\n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle CDP}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        A\n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle DAP}\n   have radii \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{1}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{2}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{3}}\n  , and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{4}}\n   respectively, then the quadrilateral is a kite if and only if\nIf the excircles to the same four triangles opposite the vertex \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n   have radii \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{1}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{2}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{3}}\n  , and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{4}}\n   respectively, then the quadrilateral is a kite if and only if\n\n\n=== Duality ===\n\nKites and isosceles trapezoids are dual to each other, meaning that there is a correspondence between them that reverses the dimension of their parts, taking vertices to sides and sides to vertices. From any kite, the inscribed circle is tangent to its four sides at the four vertices of an isosceles trapezoid. For any isosceles trapezoid, tangent lines to the circumscribing circle at its four vertices form the four sides of a kite. This correspondence can also be seen as an example of polar reciprocation, a general method for corresponding points with lines and vice versa given a fixed circle. Although they do not touch the circle, the four vertices of the kite are reciprocal in this sense to the four sides of the isosceles trapezoid. The features of kites and isosceles trapezoids that correspond to each other under this duality are compared in the table below.\n\n\n=== Dissection ===\nThe equidissection problem concerns the subdivision of polygons into triangles that all have equal areas. In this context, the spectrum of a polygon is the set of numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   such that the polygon has an equidissection into \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   equal-area triangles. Because of its symmetry, the spectrum of a kite contains all even integers. Certain special kites also contain some odd numbers in their spectra.Every triangle can be subdivided into three right kites meeting at the center of its inscribed circle. More generally, a method based on circle packing can be used to subdivide any polygon with \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   sides into \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(n)}\n   kites, meeting edge-to-edge.\n\n\n== Tilings and polyhedra ==\n\nAll kites tile the plane by repeated point reflection around the midpoints of their edges, as do more generally all quadrilaterals. Kites and darts with angles 72\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 144\u00b0 and 36\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 36\u00b0, 216\u00b0, respectively, form the prototiles of one version of the Penrose tiling, an aperiodic tiling of the plane discovered by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose. When a kite has angles that, at its apex and one side, sum to \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n        (\n        1\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi (1-{\\tfrac {1}{n}})}\n   for some positive integer \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  , then scaled copies of that kite can be used to tile the plane in a fractal rosette in which successively larger rings of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   kites surround a central point. These rosettes can be used to study the phenomenon of inelastic collapse, in which a system of moving particles meeting in inelastic collisions all coalesce at a common point.A kite with angles 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 90\u00b0 can also tile the plane by repeated reflection across its edges; the resulting tessellation, the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling, superposes a tessellation of the plane by regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. The deltoidal icositetrahedron, deltoidal hexecontahedron, and trapezohedron are polyhedra with congruent kite-shaped faces, which can alternatively be thought of as tilings of the sphere by congruent spherical kites. There are infinitely many face-symmetric tilings of the hyperbolic plane by kites. These polyhedra (equivalently, spherical tilings), the square and deltoidal trihexagonal tilings of the Euclidean plane, and some tilings of the hyperbolic plane are shown in the table below, labeled by face configuration (the numbers of neighbors of each of the four vertices of each tile). Some polyhedra and tilings appear twice, under two different face configurations.\n\nThe trapezohedra are another family of polyhedra that have congruent kite-shaped faces. In these polyhedra, the edges of one of the two side lengths of the kite meet at two \"pole\" vertices, while the edges of the other length form an equatorial zigzag path around the polyhedron. They are the dual polyhedra of the uniform antiprisms. A commonly seen example is the pentagonal trapezohedron, used for ten-sided dice.\n\n\n== Outer billiards ==\nMathematician Richard Schwartz has studied outer billiards on kites. Outer billiards is a dynamical system in which, from a point outside a given compact convex set in the plane, one draws a tangent line to the convex set, travels from the starting point along this line to another point equally far from the point of tangency, and then repeats the same process. It had been open since the 1950s whether any system defined in this way could produce paths that get arbitrarily far from their starting point, and in a 2007 paper Schwartz solved this problem by finding unbounded billiards paths for the kite with angles 72\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 144\u00b0, the same as the one used in the Penrose tiling. He later wrote a monograph analyzing outer billiards for kite shapes more generally. For this problem, any affine transformation of a kite preserves the dynamical properties of outer billiards on it, and it is possible to transform any kite into a shape where three vertices are at the points \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u2212\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (-1,0)}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \u00b1\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0,\\pm 1)}\n  , with the fourth at \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u03b1\n        ,\n        0\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\alpha ,0)}\n   with \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n   in the open unit interval \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0,1)}\n  .

That is, the circumference would be the arc length of the circle, as if it were opened up and straightened out to a line segment. More generally, the perimeter is the curve length around any closed figure. \nCircumference may also refer to the circle itself, that is, the locus corresponding to the edge of a disk. \nThe circumference of a sphere is the circumference, or length, of any one of its great circles.\n\n\n== Circle ==\nThe circumference of a circle is the distance around it, but if, as in many elementary treatments, distance is defined in terms of straight lines, this cannot be used as a definition. Under these circumstances, the circumference of a circle may be defined as the limit of the perimeters of inscribed regular polygons as the number of sides increases without bound. The term circumference is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.\n\n\n=== Relationship with \u03c0 ===\nThe circumference of a circle is related to one of the most important mathematical constants.

This method for approximating \u03c0 was used for centuries, obtaining more accuracy by using polygons of larger and larger number of sides. The last such calculation was performed in 1630 by Christoph Grienberger who used polygons with 1040 sides.\n\n\n== Ellipse ==\n\nCircumference is used by some authors to denote the perimeter of an ellipse. There is no general formula for the circumference of an ellipse in terms of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse that uses only elementary functions.

This means that the line segment between two points of the polygon is contained in the union of the interior and the boundary of the polygon.

Equivalently, a polygon is convex if every line that does not contain any edge intersects the polygon in at most two points.\nA strictly convex polygon is a convex polygon such that no line contains two of its edges. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees, while in a strictly convex polygon all interior angles are strictly less than 180 degrees.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe following properties of a simple polygon are all equivalent to convexity:\n\nEvery internal angle is strictly less than 180 degrees.\nEvery point on every line segment between two points inside or on the boundary of the polygon remains inside or on the boundary.\nThe polygon is entirely contained in a closed half-plane defined by each of its edges.\nFor each edge, the interior points are all on the same side of the line that the edge defines.\nThe angle at each vertex contains all other vertices in its edges and interior.\nThe polygon is the convex hull of its edges.Additional properties of convex polygons include:\n\nThe intersection of two convex polygons is a convex polygon.\nA convex polygon may be triangulated in linear time through a fan triangulation, consisting in adding diagonals from one vertex to all other vertices.\nHelly's theorem: For every collection of at least three convex polygons: if the intersection of every three of them is nonempty, then the whole collection has a nonempty intersection.\nKrein\u2013Milman theorem: A convex polygon is the convex hull of its vertices.

(ed.), Graphics Gems IV, Morgan Kaufmann (Academic Press), pp. 7\u201315, ISBN 9780123361554", "Parallel_(geometry)": "In geometry, parallel lines are coplanar infinite straight lines that do not intersect at any point. Parallel planes are planes in the same three-dimensional space that never meet. Parallel curves are curves that do not touch each other or intersect and keep a fixed minimum distance. In three-dimensional Euclidean space, a line and a plane that do not share a point are also said to be parallel. However, two noncoplanar lines are called skew lines. \nParallel lines are the subject of Euclid's parallel postulate. Parallelism is primarily a property of affine geometries and Euclidean geometry is a special instance of this type of geometry.\nIn some other geometries, such as hyperbolic geometry, lines can have analogous properties that are referred to as parallelism.\n\n\n== Symbol ==\nThe parallel symbol is \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2225\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\parallel }\n  . For example, \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        \u2225\n        C\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AB\\parallel CD}\n   indicates that line AB is parallel to line CD.\nIn the Unicode character set, the \"parallel\" and \"not parallel\" signs have codepoints U+2225 (\u2225) and U+2226 (\u2226), respectively. In addition, U+22D5 (\u22d5) represents the relation \"equal and parallel to\".The same symbol is used for a binary function in electrical engineering (the parallel operator). It is distinct from the double-vertical-line brackets, U+216 (\u2016), that indicate a norm (e.g. \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        x\n        \u2016\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\|x\\|}\n  ), as well as from the logical or operator (||) in several programming languages.\n\n\n== Euclidean parallelism ==\n\n\n=== Two lines in a plane ===\n\n\n==== Conditions for parallelism ====\n\nGiven parallel straight lines l and m in Euclidean space, the following properties are equivalent:\n\nEvery point on line m is located at exactly the same (minimum) distance from line l (equidistant lines).\nLine m is in the same plane as line l but does not intersect l (recall that lines extend to infinity in either direction).\nWhen lines m and l are both intersected by a third straight line (a transversal) in the same plane,  the corresponding angles of intersection with the transversal are congruent.Since these are equivalent properties, any one of them could be taken as the definition of parallel lines in Euclidean space, but the first and third properties involve measurement, and so, are \"more complicated\" than the second. Thus, the second property is the one usually chosen as the defining property of parallel lines in Euclidean geometry. The other properties are then consequences of Euclid's Parallel Postulate. Another property that also involves measurement is that lines parallel to each other have the same gradient (slope).\n\n\n==== History ====\nThe definition of parallel lines as a pair of straight lines in a plane which do not meet appears as Definition 23 in Book I of Euclid's Elements. Alternative definitions were discussed by other Greeks, often as part of an attempt to prove the parallel postulate. Proclus attributes a definition of parallel lines as equidistant lines to Posidonius and quotes Geminus in a similar vein. Simplicius also mentions Posidonius' definition as well as its modification by the philosopher Aganis.At the end of the nineteenth century, in England, Euclid's Elements was still the standard textbook in secondary schools. The traditional treatment of geometry was being pressured to change by the new developments in projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry, so several new textbooks for the teaching of geometry were written at this time. A major difference between these reform texts, both between themselves and between them and Euclid, is the treatment of parallel lines. These reform texts were not without their critics and one of them, Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), wrote a play, Euclid and His Modern Rivals, in which these texts are lambasted.One of the early reform textbooks was James Maurice Wilson's Elementary Geometry of 1868. Wilson based his definition of parallel lines on the primitive notion of direction. According to Wilhelm Killing the idea may be traced back to Leibniz. Wilson, without defining direction since it is a primitive, uses the term in other definitions such as his sixth definition, \"Two straight lines that meet one another have different directions, and the difference of their directions is the angle between them.\" Wilson (1868, p. 2) In definition 15 he introduces parallel lines in this way; \"Straight lines which have the same direction, but are not parts of the same straight line, are called parallel lines.\" Wilson (1868, p. 12) Augustus De Morgan reviewed this text and declared it a failure, primarily on the basis of this definition and the way Wilson used it to prove things about parallel lines. Dodgson also devotes a large section of his play (Act II, Scene VI \u00a7 1) to denouncing Wilson's treatment of parallels. Wilson edited this concept out of the third and higher editions of his text.Other properties, proposed by other reformers, used as replacements for the definition of parallel lines, did not fare much better. The main difficulty, as pointed out by Dodgson, was that to use them in this way required additional axioms to be added to the system. The equidistant line definition of Posidonius, expounded by Francis Cuthbertson in his 1874 text Euclidean Geometry suffers from the problem that the points that are found at a fixed given distance on one side of a straight line must be shown to form a straight line. This can not be proved and must be assumed to be true. The corresponding angles formed by a transversal property, used by W. D. Cooley in his 1860 text, The Elements of Geometry, simplified and explained requires a proof of the fact that if one transversal meets a pair of lines in congruent corresponding angles then all transversals must do so. Again, a new axiom is needed to justify this statement.\n\n\n==== Construction ====\nThe three properties above lead to three different methods of construction of parallel lines.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Distance between two parallel lines ====\n\nBecause parallel lines in a Euclidean plane are equidistant there is a unique distance between the two parallel lines. Given the equations of two non-vertical, non-horizontal parallel lines,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        m\n        x\n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=mx+b_{1}\\,}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        m\n        x\n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=mx+b_{2}\\,,}\n  the distance between the two lines can be found by locating two points (one on each line) that lie on a common perpendicular to the parallel lines and calculating the distance between them. Since the lines have slope m, a common perpendicular would have slope \u22121/m and we can take the line with equation y = \u2212x/m as a common perpendicular.

Only if they are in a common plane are they called parallel; otherwise they are called skew lines.\nTwo distinct lines l and m in three-dimensional space are parallel if and only if the distance from a point P on line m to the nearest point on line  l is independent of the location of P on line m. This never holds for skew lines.\n\n\n=== A line and a plane ===\nA line m and a plane q in three-dimensional space, the line not lying in that plane, are parallel if and only if they do not intersect.\nEquivalently, they are parallel if and only if the distance from a point P on line m to the nearest point in plane q is independent of the location of P on line m.\n\n\n=== Two planes ===\nSimilar to the fact that parallel lines must be located in the same plane, parallel planes must be situated in the same three-dimensional space and contain no point in common.\nTwo distinct planes q and r are parallel if and only if the distance from a point P in plane q to the nearest point in plane r is independent of the location of P in plane q. This will never hold if the two planes are not in the same three-dimensional space.\n\n\n== In non-Euclidean geometry ==\nIn non-Euclidean geometry, it is more common to talk about geodesics than (straight) lines. A geodesic is the shortest path between two points in a given geometry. In physics this may be interpreted as the path that a particle follows if no force is applied to it. In non-Euclidean geometry (elliptic or hyperbolic geometry) the three Euclidean properties mentioned above are not equivalent and only the second one (Line m is in the same plane as line l but does not intersect l) is useful in non-Euclidean geometries, since it involves no measurements. In general geometry the three properties above give three different types of curves,  equidistant curves, parallel geodesics and geodesics sharing a common perpendicular, respectively.\n\n\n=== Hyperbolic geometry ===\n\nWhile in Euclidean geometry two geodesics can either intersect or be parallel, in hyperbolic geometry, there are three possibilities. Two geodesics belonging to the same plane can either be:\n\nintersecting, if they intersect in a common point in the plane,\nparallel, if they do not intersect in the plane, but converge to a common limit point at infinity (ideal point), or\nultra parallel, if they do not have a common limit point at infinity.In the literature ultra parallel geodesics are often called non-intersecting.  Geodesics intersecting at infinity are called limiting parallel.\nAs in the illustration through a point a not on line l there are two limiting parallel lines, one for each direction ideal point of line l. They separate the lines intersecting line l and those that are ultra parallel to line l.\nUltra parallel lines have single common perpendicular (ultraparallel theorem), and diverge on both sides of this common perpendicular.\n\n\n=== Spherical or elliptic geometry ===\n\nIn spherical geometry, all geodesics are great circles. Great circles divide the sphere in two equal hemispheres and all great circles intersect each other. Thus, there are no parallel geodesics to a given geodesic, as all geodesics intersect. Equidistant curves on the sphere are called parallels of latitude analogous to the latitude lines on a globe. Parallels of latitude can be generated by the intersection of the sphere with a plane parallel to a plane through the center of the sphere.\n\n\n== Reflexive variant ==\nIf l, m, n are three distinct lines, then \n  \n    \n      \n        l\n        \u2225\n        m\n         \n        \u2227\n         \n        m\n        \u2225\n        n\n         \n        \n        \u27f9\n        \n         \n        l\n        \u2225\n        n\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle l\\parallel m\\ \\land \\ m\\parallel n\\ \\implies \\ l\\parallel n.}\n  \nIn this case, parallelism is a transitive relation. However, in case l = n, the superimposed lines are not considered parallel in Euclidean geometry. The binary relation between parallel lines is evidently a symmetric relation. According to Euclid's tenets, parallelism is not a reflexive relation and thus fails to be an equivalence relation. Nevertheless, in affine geometry a pencil of parallel lines is taken as an equivalence class in the set of lines where parallelism is an equivalence relation.To this end, Emil Artin (1957) adopted a definition of parallelism where two lines are parallel if they have all or none of their points in common.\nThen a line is parallel to itself so that the reflexive and transitive properties belong to this type of parallelism, creating an equivalence relation on the set of lines. In the study of incidence geometry, this variant of parallelism is used in the affine plane.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClifford parallel\nCollinearity\nConcurrent lines\nLimiting parallel\nParallel curve\nUltraparallel theorem\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHeath, Thomas L.

The result of uniform scaling is similar (in the geometric sense) to the original.  A scale factor of 1 is normally allowed, so that congruent shapes are also classed as similar.  Uniform scaling happens, for example, when enlarging or reducing a photograph, or when creating a scale model of a building, car, airplane, etc.\nMore general is scaling with a separate scale factor for each axis direction. Non-uniform scaling (anisotropic scaling) is obtained when at least one of the scaling factors is different from the others; a special case is directional scaling or stretching (in one direction). Non-uniform scaling changes the shape of the object; e.g. a square may change into a rectangle, or into a parallelogram if the sides of the square are not parallel to the scaling axes (the angles between lines parallel to the axes are preserved, but not all angles).  It occurs, for example, when a faraway billboard is viewed from an oblique angle, or when the shadow of a flat object falls on a surface that is not parallel to it.\nWhen the scale factor is larger than 1, (uniform or non-uniform) scaling is sometimes also called dilation or enlargement. When the scale factor is a positive number smaller than 1, scaling is sometimes also called contraction or reduction.\nIn the most general sense, a scaling includes the case in which the directions of scaling are not perpendicular. It also includes the case in which one or more scale factors are equal to zero (projection), and the case of one or more negative scale factors (a directional scaling by -1 is equivalent to a reflection).\nScaling is a linear transformation, and a special case of homothetic transformation (scaling about a point). In most cases, the homothetic transformations are non-linear transformations.\n\n\n== Uniform scaling ==\n\nA scale factor is usually a decimal which scales, or multiplies, some quantity. In the equation y = Cx, C is the scale factor for x. C is also the coefficient of x, and may be called the constant of proportionality of y to x.  For example, doubling distances corresponds to a scale factor of two for distance, while cutting a cake in half results in pieces with a scale factor for volume of one half.  The basic equation for it is image over preimage.\nIn the field of measurements, the scale factor of an instrument is sometimes referred to as sensitivity.  The ratio of any two corresponding lengths in two similar geometric figures is also called a scale.\n\n\n== Matrix representation ==\nA scaling can be represented by a scaling matrix.  To scale an object by a vector v = (vx, vy, vz), each point p = (px, py, pz) would need to be multiplied with this scaling matrix:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n

 Such a scaling changes the diameter of an object by a factor between the scale factors, the area by a factor between the smallest and the largest product of two scale factors, and the volume by the product of all three.\nThe scaling is uniform if and only if the scaling factors are equal (vx = vy = vz). If all except one of the scale factors are equal to 1, we have directional scaling.\nIn the case where vx = vy = vz = k, scaling increases the area of any surface by a factor of k2 and the volume of any solid object by a factor of k3.\n\n\n=== Scaling in arbitrary dimensions ===\nIn \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  -dimensional space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n  , uniform scaling by a factor \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n   is accomplished by scalar multiplication with \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  , that is, multiplying each coordinate of each point by \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  .

In non-uniform scaling only the vectors that belong to an eigenspace will retain their direction. A vector that is the sum of two or more non-zero vectors belonging to different eigenspaces will be tilted towards the eigenspace with largest eigenvalue.\n\n\n== Using homogeneous coordinates ==\nIn projective geometry, often used in computer graphics, points are represented using homogeneous coordinates. To scale an object by a vector v = (vx, vy, vz), each homogeneous coordinate vector p = (px, py, pz, 1) would need to be multiplied with this projective transformation matrix:\n\n  \n    \n      \n

External links ==\n\nUnderstanding 2D Scaling and Understanding 3D Scaling by Roger Germundsson, The Wolfram Demonstrations Project.\nScale Factor Calculator", "Rhombus": "In plane Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (plural rhombi or rhombuses) is a quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a \"diamond\", after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60\u00b0 angle (which some authors call a calisson after the French sweet \u2013 also see Polyiamond), and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45\u00b0 angle.\nEvery rhombus is simple (non-self-intersecting), and is a special case of a parallelogram and a kite. A rhombus with right angles is a square.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"rhombus\" comes from Ancient Greek: \u1fe5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, romanized: rhombos, meaning something that spins, which derives from the verb \u1fe5\u03ad\u03bc\u03b2\u03c9, romanized: rh\u00e9mb\u014d, meaning \"to turn round and round.\" The word was used both by Euclid and  Archimedes, who used the term \"solid rhombus\" for a bicone, two right circular cones sharing a common base.The surface we refer to as rhombus today is a cross section of the bicone on a plane through the apexes of the two cones.\n\n\n== Characterizations ==\nA simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral is a rhombus if and only if it is any one of the following:\na parallelogram in which a diagonal bisects an interior angle\na parallelogram in which at least two consecutive sides are equal in length\na parallelogram in which the diagonals are perpendicular (an orthodiagonal parallelogram)\na quadrilateral with four sides of equal length (by definition)\na quadrilateral in which the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other\na quadrilateral in which each diagonal bisects two opposite interior angles\na quadrilateral ABCD possessing a point P in its plane such that the four triangles ABP, BCP, CDP, and DAP are all congruent\na quadrilateral ABCD in which the incircles in triangles ABC, BCD, CDA and DAB have a common point\n\n\n== Basic properties ==\nEvery rhombus has two diagonals connecting pairs of opposite vertices, and two pairs of parallel sides. Using congruent triangles, one can prove that the rhombus is symmetric across each of these diagonals. It follows that any rhombus has the following properties:\n\nOpposite angles of a rhombus have equal measure.\nThe two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular; that is, a rhombus is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral.\nIts diagonals bisect opposite angles.The first property implies that every rhombus is a parallelogram. A rhombus therefore has all of the properties of a parallelogram: for example, opposite sides are parallel; adjacent angles are supplementary; the two diagonals bisect one another; any line through the midpoint bisects the area; and the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals (the parallelogram law). Thus denoting the common side as a and the diagonals as p and q, in every rhombus\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          4\n          \n            a\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          =\n          \n            p\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          +\n          \n            q\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\displaystyle 4a^{2}=p^{2}+q^{2}.}\n  Not every parallelogram is a rhombus, though any parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals (the second property) is a rhombus. In general, any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, one of which is a line of symmetry, is a kite. Every rhombus is a kite, and any quadrilateral that is both a kite and parallelogram is a rhombus.\nA rhombus is a tangential quadrilateral. That is, it has an inscribed circle that is tangent to all four sides.\n\n\n== Diagonals ==\nThe length of the diagonals p = AC and q = BD can be expressed in terms of the rhombus side a and one vertex angle \u03b1 as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        a\n        \n          \n            2\n            +\n            2\n            cos\n            \u2061\n            \n              \u03b1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p=a{\\sqrt {2+2\\cos {\\alpha }}}}\n  and\n\n  \n    \n      \n        q\n        =\n        a\n        \n          \n            2\n            \u2212\n            2\n            cos\n            \u2061\n            \n              \u03b1\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle q=a{\\sqrt {2-2\\cos {\\alpha }}}.}\n  These formulas are a direct consequence of the law of cosines.\n\n\n== Inradius ==\nThe inradius (the radius of a circle inscribed in the rhombus), denoted by r, can be expressed in terms of the diagonals p and q as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              p\n              \u22c5\n              q\n            \n            \n              2\n              \n                \n                  \n                    p\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    q\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r={\\frac {p\\cdot q}{2{\\sqrt {p^{2}+q^{2}}}}},}\n  or in terms of the side length a and any vertex angle \u03b1 or \u03b2 as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              sin\n              \u2061\n              \u03b1\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              sin\n              \u2061\n              \u03b2\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r={\\frac {a\\sin \\alpha }{2}}={\\frac {a\\sin \\beta }{2}}.}\n  \n\n\n== Area ==\nAs for all parallelograms, the area K of a rhombus is the product of its base and its height (h).

A variety of methods are known for constructing a regular pentagon. Some are discussed below.\n\n\n==== Richmond's method ====\n\nOne method to construct a regular pentagon in a given circle is described by Richmond and further discussed in Cromwell's Polyhedra.The top panel shows the construction used in Richmond's method to create the side of the inscribed pentagon. The circle defining the pentagon has unit radius. Its center is located at point C and a midpoint M is marked halfway along its radius. This point is joined to the periphery vertically above the center at point D. Angle CMD is bisected, and the bisector intersects the vertical axis at point Q. A horizontal line through Q intersects the circle at point P, and chord PD is the required side of the inscribed pentagon.\nTo determine the length of this side, the two right triangles DCM and QCM are depicted below the circle. Using Pythagoras' theorem and two sides, the hypotenuse of the larger triangle is found as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              5\n            \n          \n          \n            /\n          \n          2\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {\\sqrt {5}}/2}\n  . Side h of the smaller triangle then is found using the half-angle formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03d5\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              \u2212\n              cos\n              \u2061\n              (\n              \u03d5\n              )\n            \n            \n              sin\n              \u2061\n              (\n              \u03d5\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n         \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan(\\phi /2)={\\frac {1-\\cos(\\phi )}{\\sin(\\phi )}}\\ ,}\n  where cosine and sine of \u03d5 are known from the larger triangle. The result is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  5\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              1\n            \n            4\n          \n        \n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h={\\frac {{\\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}}\\ .}\n  If DP is truly the side of a regular pentagon, \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        \u2220\n        \n          C\n          D\n          P\n        \n        =\n        \n          54\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m\\angle \\mathrm {CDP} =54^{\\circ }}\n  , so DP = 2 cos(54\u00b0), QD = DP cos(54\u00b0) = 2cos2(54\u00b0), and CQ = 1 \u2212 2cos2(54\u00b0), which equals \u2212cos(108\u00b0) by the cosine double angle formula.  This is the cosine of 72\u00b0, which equals \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                5\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n          )\n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {5}}-1\\right)/4}\n   as desired.\n\n\n==== Carlyle circles ====\n\nThe Carlyle circle was invented as a geometric method to find the roots of a quadratic equation. This methodology leads to a procedure for constructing a regular pentagon. The steps are as follows:\nDraw a circle in which to inscribe the pentagon and mark the center point O.\nDraw a horizontal line through the center of the circle. Mark the left intersection with the circle as point B.\nConstruct a vertical line through the center. Mark one intersection with the circle as point A.\nConstruct the point M as the midpoint of O and B.\nDraw a circle centered at M through the point A. Mark its intersection with the horizontal line (inside the original circle) as the point W and its intersection outside the circle as the point V.\nDraw a circle of radius OA and center W. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon.\nDraw a circle of radius OA and center V. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon.\nThe fifth vertex is the rightmost intersection of the horizontal line with the original circle.Steps 6\u20138 are equivalent to the following version, shown in the animation:\n\n6a. Construct point F as the midpoint of O and W.7a. Construct a vertical line through F. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon. The third vertex is the rightmost intersection of the horizontal line with the original circle.8a. Construct the other two vertices using the compass and the length of the vertex found in step 7a.\n\n\n==== Euclid's method ====\n\nA regular pentagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge, either by inscribing one in a given circle or constructing one on a given edge. This process was described by Euclid in his Elements circa 300 BC.\n\n\n=== Physical construction methods ===\n\nA regular pentagon may be created from just a strip of paper by tying an overhand knot into the strip and carefully flattening the knot by pulling the ends of the paper strip. Folding one of the ends back over the pentagon will reveal a pentagram when backlit.\nConstruct a regular hexagon on stiff paper or card. Crease along the three diameters between opposite vertices. Cut from one vertex to the center to make an equilateral triangular flap. Fix this flap underneath its neighbor to make a pentagonal pyramid. The base of the pyramid is a regular pentagon.\n\n\n=== Symmetry ===\n\nThe regular pentagon has Dih5 symmetry, order 10. Since 5 is a prime number there is one subgroup with dihedral symmetry: Dih1, and 2 cyclic group symmetries: Z5, and Z1.\nThese 4 symmetries can be seen in 4 distinct symmetries on the pentagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r10 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g5 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.\n\n\n=== Regular pentagram ===\n\nA pentagram or pentangle is a regular star pentagon. Its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is {5/2}. Its sides form the diagonals of a regular convex pentagon \u2013 in this arrangement the sides of the two pentagons are in the golden ratio.\n\n\n== Equilateral pentagons ==\n\nAn equilateral pentagon is a polygon with five sides of equal length. However, its five internal angles can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons. In contrast, the regular pentagon is unique up to similarity, because it is equilateral and it is equiangular (its five angles are equal).\n\n\n== Cyclic pentagons ==\nA cyclic pentagon is one for which a circle called the circumcircle goes through all five vertices. The regular pentagon is an example of a cyclic pentagon.  The area of a cyclic pentagon, whether regular or not, can be expressed as one fourth the square root of one of the roots of a septic equation whose coefficients are functions of the sides of the pentagon.There exist cyclic pentagons with rational sides and rational area; these are called Robbins pentagons. It has been proven that the diagonals of a Robbins pentagon must be either all rational or all irrational, and it is conjectured that all the diagonals must be rational.\n\n\n== General convex pentagons ==\nFor all convex pentagons, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is less than 3 times the sum of the squares of the sides.:\u200ap.75,\u200a#1854\u200a\n\n\n== Pentagons in tiling ==\n\nA regular pentagon cannot appear in any tiling of regular polygons. First, to prove a pentagon cannot form a regular tiling (one in which all faces are congruent, thus requiring that all the polygons be pentagons), observe that 360\u00b0 / 108\u00b0 = 31\u20443 (where 108\u00b0 Is the interior angle), which is not a whole number; hence there exists no integer number of pentagons sharing a single vertex and leaving no gaps between them.  More difficult is proving a pentagon cannot be in any edge-to-edge tiling made by regular polygons:\nThe maximum known packing density of a regular pentagon is approximately 0.921, achieved by the double lattice packing shown. In a preprint released in 2016, Thomas Hales and W\u00f6den Kusner announced a proof that the double lattice packing of the regular pentagon (which they call the \"pentagonal ice-ray\" packing, and which they trace to the work of Chinese artisans in 1900) has the optimal density among all packings of regular pentagons in the plane. As of 2020, their proof has not yet been refereed and published.\nThere are no combinations of regular polygons with 4 or more meeting at a vertex that contain a pentagon. For combinations with 3, if 3 polygons meet at a vertex and one has an odd number of sides, the other 2 must be congruent. The reason for this is that the polygons that touch the edges of the pentagon must alternate around the pentagon, which is impossible because of the pentagon's odd number of sides. For the pentagon, this results in a polygon whose angles are all (360 \u2212 108) / 2 = 126\u00b0. To find the number of sides this polygon has, the result is 360 / (180 \u2212 126) = 62\u20443, which is not a whole number. Therefore, a pentagon cannot appear in any tiling made by regular polygons.\nThere are 15 classes of pentagons that can monohedrally tile the plane.

Both quantities can be calculated efficiently using rotating calipers. For a curve of constant width such as the Reuleaux triangle, the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance.\n\nFor an ellipse, the standard terminology is different. A diameter of an ellipse is any chord passing through the centre of the ellipse. For example, conjugate diameters have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the conjugate diameter. The longest diameter is called the major axis.\nThe word \"diameter\" is derived from Ancient Greek: \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (diametros), \"diameter of a circle\", from \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac (dia), \"across, through\" and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (metron), \"measure\".

In medical parlance concerning a lesion or in geology concerning a rock, the diameter of an object is the least upper bound of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the object.\nIn differential geometry, the diameter is an important global Riemannian invariant.\nIn planar geometry, a diameter of a conic section is typically defined as any chord which passes through the conic's centre; such diameters are not necessarily of uniform length, except in the case of the circle, which has eccentricity \n  \n    \n      \n        e\n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e=0.}\n  \n\n\n== Symbol ==\n\nThe symbol or variable for diameter, \u2300, is sometimes used in technical drawings or specifications as a prefix or suffix for a number (e.g. \"\u2300 55 mm\"), indicating that it represents diameter. For example, photographic filter thread sizes are often denoted in this way.\nIn German, the diameter symbol (German Durchmesserzeichen) is also used as an average symbol (Durchschnittszeichen).\n\n\n=== Similar symbols ===\nThe Latin small letter o with stroke \u00f8 is similar in size and design to this. The diameter symbol \u2300 is distinct from the empty set symbol \u2205, from an (italic) uppercase phi \u03a6, and from the Nordic vowel \u00d8 (Latin capital letter O with stroke). See also slashed zero.\n\n\n=== Encodings ===\nThe symbol has a Unicode code point at U+2300 \u2300 DIAMETER SIGN, in the Miscellaneous Technical set. On an Apple Macintosh, the diameter symbol can be entered via the character palette (this is opened by pressing \u2325 Opt\u2318 CmdT in most applications), where it can be found in the Technical Symbols category. In Unix/Linux/ChromeOS systems, it is generated using Ctrl+\u21e7 Shift+U 2300space. It can be obtained in Unix-like operating systems using a Compose key by pressing, in sequence, Composedi. In Windows, it can be entered in most programs with Alt code 8960.\nThe character will sometimes not display correctly, however, since many fonts do not include it. In many situations, the Nordic letter \u00f8 at Unicode U+00F8 \u00f8 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE (&oslash;) is an acceptable substitute. It can be entered on a Macintosh by pressing \u2325 OptO (the letter o, not the number 0). In Unix/Linux/ChromeOS systems, it is generated using Ctrl+\u21e7 Shift+U F8space or Composeo/. AutoCAD uses U+2205 \u2205 EMPTY SET available as a shortcut string %%c.\nIn Microsoft Word, the diameter symbol can be acquired by typing 2300 and then pressing Alt+X.\nIn LaTeX, the diameter symbol can be obtained with the command \\diameter from the \"wasysym\" package.\n\n\n== Diameter vs. radius ==\nThe diameter of a circle is exactly twice its radius. However, this is true only for a circle, and only in the Euclidean metric. The page on Jung's theorem discusses some more general inequalities relating the diameter to the radius.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Tangent": "In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that \"just touches\" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a tangent line approximation, the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".\n\n\n== History ==\nEuclid makes several references to the tangent (\u1f10\u03c6\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 ephaptom\u00e9n\u0113) to a circle in book III of the Elements  (c. 300 BC). In Apollonius' work Conics (c. 225 BC) he defines a tangent as being a line such that no other straight line could\nfall between it and the curve.\nArchimedes (c.\u2009 287 \u2013 c. \u2009212 BC) found the tangent to an Archimedean spiral by considering the path of a point moving along the curve.In the 1630s Fermat developed the technique of adequality to calculate tangents and other problems in analysis and used this to calculate tangents to the parabola. The technique of adequality is similar to taking the difference between \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x+h)}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n   and dividing by a power of \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n  . Independently Descartes used his method of normals based on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.These methods led to the development of differential calculus in the 17th century. Many people contributed. Roberval discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.Ren\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois de Sluse and Johannes Hudde found algebraic algorithms for finding tangents. Further developments included those of John Wallis and Isaac Barrow, leading to the theory of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.\nAn 1828 definition of a tangent was \"a right line which touches a curve, but which when produced, does not cut it\". This old definition prevents inflection points from having any tangent. It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of Leibniz, who defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve.\n\n\n== Tangent line to a plane curve ==\n\nThe intuitive notion that a tangent line \"touches\" a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines (secant lines) passing through two points, A and B, those that lie on the function curve. The tangent at A is the limit when point B approximates or tends to A. The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness, known as \"differentiability.\" For example, if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point (a vertex) then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which \"point B\" approaches the vertex.\nAt most points, the tangent touches the curve without crossing it (though it may, when continued, cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent). A point where the tangent (at this point) crosses the curve is called an inflection point. Circles, parabolas, hyperbolas and ellipses do not have any inflection point, but more complicated curves do have, like the graph of a cubic function, which has exactly one inflection point, or a sinusoid, which has two inflection points per each period of the sine.\nConversely, it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it, and yet this straight line is not a tangent line. This is the case, for example, for a line passing through the vertex of a triangle and not intersecting it otherwise\u2014where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above. In convex geometry, such lines are called supporting lines.\n\n\n=== Analytical approach ===\nThe geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly. The question of finding the tangent line to a graph, or the tangent line problem, was one of the central questions leading to the development of calculus in the 17th century. In the second book of his Geometry, Ren\u00e9 Descartes said of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve, \"And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know\".\n\n\n==== Intuitive description ====\nSuppose that a curve is given as the graph of a function, y = f(x). To find the tangent line at the point p = (a, f(a)), consider another nearby point q = (a + h, f(a + h)) on the curve. The slope of the secant line passing through p and q is equal to the difference quotient\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              f\n              (\n              a\n              +\n              h\n              )\n              \u2212\n              f\n              (\n              a\n              )\n            \n            h\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}.}\n  As the point q approaches p, which corresponds to making h smaller and smaller, the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value k, which is the slope of the tangent line at the point p. If k is known, the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point-slope form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        \u2212\n        f\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        k\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        a\n        )\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y-f(a)=k(x-a).\\,}\n  \n\n\n==== More rigorous description ====\nTo make the preceding reasoning rigorous, one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value k. The precise mathematical formulation was given by Cauchy in the 19th century and is based on the notion of limit. Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at p and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near p. Then there is a unique value of k such that, as h approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to k, and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of h, if h is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function f. This limit is the derivative of the function f at x = a, denoted f \u2032(a). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        +\n        \n          f\n          \u2032\n        \n        (\n        a\n        )\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        a\n        )\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).\\,}\n  Calculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas, such as the power function, trigonometric functions, exponential function, logarithm, and their various combinations. Thus, equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions, as well as many others, can be found by the methods of calculus.\n\n\n==== How the method can fail ====\nCalculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist. For these points the function f is non-differentiable. There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail: either the geometric tangent exists, but it is a vertical line, which cannot be given in the point-slope form since it does not have a slope, or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent.\nThe graph y = x1/3 illustrates the first possibility:  here the difference quotient at a = 0 is equal to h1/3/h = h\u22122/3, which becomes very large as h approaches 0. This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical.\nThe graph y = x2/3 illustrates another possibility: this graph has a cusp at the origin. This means that, when h approaches 0, the difference quotient at a = 0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of x. Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which y=0, but none is near to the negative part of this line. Basically, there is no tangent at the origin in this case, but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent, and even, in algebraic geometry, as a double tangent.\nThe graph y = |x| of the absolute value function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin. As a point q approaches the origin from the right, the secant line always has slope 1. As a point q approaches the origin from the left, the secant line always has slope \u22121. Therefore, there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin. Having two different (but finite) slopes is called a corner.\nFinally, since differentiability implies continuity, the contrapositive states discontinuity implies non-differentiability. Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line. This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity, leading to an infinite jump discontinuity\n\n\n=== Equations ===\nWhen the curve is given by y = f(x) then the slope of the tangent is \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        y\n        \n          /\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dy/dx,}\n  \nso by the point\u2013slope formula the equation of the tangent line at (X, Y) is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        \u2212\n        Y\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y-Y={\\frac {dy}{dx}}(X)\\cdot (x-X)}\n  where (x, y) are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line, and where the derivative is evaluated at \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=X}\n  .When the curve is given by y = f(x), the tangent line's equation can also be found by using polynomial division to divide \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\,(x)}\n   by \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        X\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x-X)^{2}}\n  ; if the remainder is denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g(x)}\n  , then the equation of the tangent line is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=g(x).}\n  When the equation of the curve is given in the form  f(x, y) = 0 then the value of the slope can be found by implicit differentiation, giving\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            /\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              y\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}=-{\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}{\\bigg /}{\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial y}}.}\n  The equation of the tangent line at a point (X,Y) such that f(X,Y) = 0 is then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        X\n        )\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              y\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        y\n        \u2212\n        Y\n        )\n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}(X,Y)\\cdot (x-X)+{\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial y}}(X,Y)\\cdot (y-Y)=0.}\n  This equation remains true if\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              y\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        \u2260\n        0\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial y}}(X,Y)=0,\\quad {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}(X,Y)\\neq 0,}\n  in which case the slope of the tangent is infinite.

Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables (or by translating the curve) this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point.\nFor example, the equation of the lima\u00e7on trisectrix shown to the right is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        2\n        a\n        x\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2}-2ax)^{2}=a^{2}(x^{2}+y^{2}).\\,}\n  Expanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        3\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}(3x^{2}-y^{2})=0\\,}\n  which, when factored, becomes\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \u00b1\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=\\pm {\\sqrt {3}}x.}\n  So these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin.When the curve is not self-crossing, the tangent at a reference point may still not be uniquely defined because the curve is not differentiable at that point although it is differentiable elsewhere. In this case the left and right derivatives are defined as the limits of the derivative as the point at which it is evaluated approaches the reference point from respectively the left (lower values) or the right (higher values). For example, the curve y = |x | is not differentiable at x = 0: its left and right derivatives have respective slopes \u22121 and 1; the tangents at that point with those slopes are called the left and right tangents.Sometimes the slopes of the left and right tangent lines are equal, so the tangent lines coincide. This is true, for example, for the curve y = x 2/3, for which both the left and right derivatives at x = 0 are infinite; both the left and right tangent lines have equation x = 0.\n\n\n== Tangent line to a space curve ==\n\n\n== Tangent circles ==\n\nTwo circles of non-equal radius, both in the same plane, are said to be tangent to each other if they meet at only one point.

The relation between the sides and other angles of the right triangle is the basis for trigonometry.\nThe side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse (side c in the figure). The sides adjacent to the right angle are called legs (or catheti, singular: cathetus). Side a may be identified as the side adjacent to angle B and opposed to (or opposite) angle A, while side b is the side adjacent to angle A and opposed to angle B.\nIf the lengths of all three sides of a right triangle are integers, the triangle is said to be a Pythagorean triangle and its side lengths are collectively known as a Pythagorean triple.\n\n\n== Principal properties ==\n\n\n=== Area ===\nAs with any triangle, the area is equal to one half the base multiplied by the corresponding height.

A corollary is that the length of the hypotenuse is twice the distance from the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. Also, the center of the circle that circumscribes a right triangle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse and its radius is one half the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n\n== Medians ==\nThe following formulas hold for the medians of a right triangle:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          m\n          \n            b\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        5\n        \n          m\n          \n            c\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            5\n            4\n          \n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{a}^{2}+m_{b}^{2}=5m_{c}^{2}={\\frac {5}{4}}c^{2}.}\n  The median on the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the triangle into two isosceles triangles, because the median equals one-half the hypotenuse.\nThe medians ma and mb from the legs satisfy:\u200ap.136,\u200a#3110\u200a\n\n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        \n          c\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        +\n        9\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        16\n        \n          m\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          m\n          \n            b\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4c^{4}+9a^{2}b^{2}=16m_{a}^{2}m_{b}^{2}.}\n  \n\n\n== Euler line ==\nIn a right triangle, the Euler line contains the median on the hypotenuse\u2014that is, it goes through both the right-angled vertex and the midpoint of the side opposite that vertex.

That is, a figure which does not change upon undergoing a reflection has reflectional symmetry.\nIn 2D there is a line/axis of symmetry, in 3D a plane of symmetry. An object or figure which is indistinguishable from its transformed image is called mirror symmetric. In conclusion, a line of symmetry splits the shape in half and those halves should be identical.\n\n\n== Symmetric function ==\n\nIn formal terms, a mathematical object is symmetric with respect to a given operation such as reflection, rotation or translation, if, when applied to the object, this operation preserves some property of the object. The set of operations that preserve a given property of the object form a group. Two objects are symmetric to each other with respect to a given group of operations if one is obtained from the other by some of the operations (and vice versa).\nThe symmetric function of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, for each perpendicular constructed, if the perpendicular intersects the figure at a distance 'd' from the axis along the perpendicular, then there exists another intersection of the shape and the perpendicular, at the same distance 'd' from the axis, in the opposite direction along the perpendicular.\nAnother way to think about the symmetric function is that if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror images.Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry.\n\n\n== Symmetric geometrical shapes ==\nTriangles with reflection symmetry are isosceles. Quadrilaterals with reflection symmetry are kites, (concave) deltoids, rhombi, and isosceles trapezoids. All even-sided polygons have two simple reflective forms, one with lines of reflections through vertices, and one through edges.\nFor an arbitrary shape, the axiality of the shape measures how close it is to being bilaterally symmetric. It equals 1 for shapes with reflection symmetry, and between 2/3 and 1 for any convex shape.\n\n\n== Advanced types of reflection symmetry ==\nFor more general types of reflection there are correspondingly more general types of reflection symmetry. For example:\n\nwith respect to a non-isometric affine involution (an oblique reflection in a line, plane, etc.)\nwith respect to circle inversion.\n\n\n== In nature ==\n\nAnimals that are bilaterally symmetric have reflection symmetry in the sagittal plane, which divides the body vertically into left and right halves, with one of each sense organ and limb pair on either side. Most animals are bilaterally symmetric, likely because this supports forward movement and streamlining.\n\n\n== In architecture ==\n\nMirror symmetry is often used in architecture, as in the facade of Santa Maria Novella, Florence. It is also found in the design of ancient structures such as Stonehenge. Symmetry was a core element in some styles of architecture, such as Palladianism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPatterns in nature\nPoint reflection symmetry\nCoxeter group theory of Reflection groups in Euclidean space\nRotational symmetry (different type of symmetry)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== General ===\nStewart, Ian (2001).

An obtuse triangle (or obtuse-angled triangle) is a triangle with one obtuse angle (greater than 90\u00b0) and two acute angles. Since a triangle's angles must sum to 180\u00b0 in Euclidean geometry, no Euclidean triangle can have more than one obtuse angle.\nAcute and obtuse triangles are the two different types of oblique triangles \u2014 triangles that are not right triangles because they do not have a 90\u00b0 angle.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nIn all triangles, the centroid\u2014the intersection of the medians, each of which connects a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side\u2014and the incenter\u2014the center of the circle that is internally tangent to all three sides\u2014are in the interior of the triangle. However, while the orthocenter and the circumcenter are in an acute triangle's interior, they are exterior to an obtuse triangle.\nThe orthocenter is the intersection point of the triangle's three altitudes, each of which perpendicularly connects a side to the opposite vertex. In the case of an acute triangle, all three of these segments lie entirely in the triangle's interior, and so they intersect in the interior. But for an obtuse triangle, the altitudes from the two acute angles intersect only the extensions of the opposite sides. These altitudes\nfall entirely outside the triangle, resulting in their intersection with each other (and hence with the extended altitude from the obtuse-angled vertex) occurring in the triangle's exterior.\nLikewise, a triangle's circumcenter\u2014the intersection of the three sides' perpendicular bisectors, which is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices\u2014falls inside an acute triangle but outside an obtuse triangle.\nThe right triangle is the in-between case: both its circumcenter and its orthocenter lie on its boundary.\nIn any triangle, any two angle measures A and B opposite sides a and b respectively are related according to:\u200ap. 264\u200a\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        >\n        B\n        \n        \n          if and only if\n        \n        \n        a\n        >\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A>B\\quad {\\text{if and only if}}\\quad a>b.}\n  This implies that the longest side in an obtuse triangle is the one opposite the obtuse-angled vertex.\nAn acute triangle has three inscribed squares, each with one side coinciding with part of a side of the triangle and with the square's other two vertices on the remaining two sides of the triangle. (In a right triangle two of these are merged into the same square, so there are only two distinct inscribed squares.) However, an obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, one of whose sides coincides with part of the longest side of the triangle.:\u200ap. 115\u200aAll triangles in which the Euler line is parallel to one side are acute.

MathWorld.\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Obtuse triangle\". MathWorld.", "Trigonometric_functions": "In mathematics, the trigonometric functions (also called circular functions, angle functions or goniometric functions) are real functions which relate an angle of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. They are widely used in all sciences that are related to geometry, such as navigation, solid mechanics, celestial mechanics, geodesy, and many others. They are among the simplest periodic functions, and as such are also widely used for studying periodic phenomena through Fourier analysis.\nThe trigonometric functions most widely used in modern mathematics are the sine, the cosine, and the tangent. Their reciprocals are respectively the cosecant, the secant, and the cotangent, which are less used. Each of these six trigonometric functions has a corresponding inverse function, and an analog among the hyperbolic functions.\nThe oldest definitions of trigonometric functions, related to right-angle triangles, define them only for acute angles. To extend the sine and cosine functions to functions whose domain is the whole real line, geometrical definitions using the standard unit circle (i.e., a circle with radius 1 unit) are often used; then the domain of the other functions is the real line with some isolated points removed. Modern definitions express trigonometric functions as infinite series or as solutions of differential equations. This allows extending the domain of sine and cosine functions to the whole complex plane, and the domain of the other trigonometric functions to the complex plane with some isolated points removed.\n\n\n== Notation ==\nConventionally, an abbreviation of each trigonometric function's name is used as its symbol in formulas. Today, the most common versions of these abbreviations are \"sin\" for sine, \"cos\" for cosine, \"tan\" or \"tg\" for tangent, \"sec\" for secant, \"csc\" or \"cosec\" for cosecant, and \"cot\" or \"ctg\" for cotangent. Historically, these abbreviations were first used in prose sentences to indicate particular line segments or their lengths related to an arc of an arbitrary circle, and later to indicate ratios of lengths, but as the function concept developed in the 17th\u201318th century, they began to be considered as functions of real-number-valued angle measures, and written with functional notation, for example sin(x).

This means that the ratio of any two side lengths depends only on \u03b8. Thus these six ratios define six functions of \u03b8, which are the trigonometric functions. In the following definitions, the hypotenuse is the length of the side opposite the right angle, opposite represents the side opposite the given angle \u03b8, and adjacent represents the side between the angle \u03b8 and the right angle.\nIn a right-angled triangle, the sum of the two acute angles is a right angle, that is, 90\u00b0 or \u03c0/2 radians. Therefore \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(\\theta )}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          90\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos(90^{\\circ }-\\theta )}\n   represent the same ratio, and thus are equal.  This identity and analogous relationships between the other trigonometric functions are summarized in the following table.\n\n\n== Radians versus degrees ==\nIn geometric applications, the argument of a trigonometric function is generally the measure of an angle. For this purpose, any angular unit is convenient.  One common unit is degrees, in which a right angle is 90\u00b0 and a complete turn is 360\u00b0 (particularly in elementary mathematics).\nHowever, in calculus and mathematical analysis, the trigonometric functions are generally regarded more abstractly as functions of real or complex numbers, rather than angles.  In fact, the functions sin and cos can be defined for all complex numbers in terms of the exponential function, via power series, or as solutions to differential equations given particular initial values (see below), without reference to any geometric notions. The other four trigonometric functions (tan, cot, sec, csc) can be defined as quotients and reciprocals of sin and cos, except where zero occurs in the denominator.  It can be proved, for real arguments, that these definitions coincide with elementary geometric definitions if the argument is regarded as an angle given in radians. Moreover, these definitions result in simple expressions for the derivatives and indefinite integrals for the trigonometric functions. Thus, in settings beyond elementary geometry, radians are regarded as the mathematically natural unit for describing angle measures.\nWhen radians (rad) are employed, the angle is given as the length of the arc of the unit circle subtended by it: the angle that subtends an arc of length 1 on the unit circle is 1 rad (\u2248 57.3\u00b0), and a complete turn (360\u00b0) is an angle of 2\u03c0 (\u2248 6.28) rad.  For real number x, the notations sin x, cos x, etc. refer to the value of the trigonometric functions evaluated at an angle of x rad.  If units of degrees are intended, the degree sign must be explicitly shown (e.g., sin x\u00b0, cos x\u00b0, etc.).  Using this standard notation, the argument x for the trigonometric functions satisfies the relationship x = (180x/\u03c0)\u00b0, so that, for example, sin \u03c0 = sin 180\u00b0 when we take x = \u03c0.  In this way, the degree symbol can be regarded as a mathematical constant such that 1\u00b0 = \u03c0/180 \u2248 0.0175.\n\n\n== Unit-circle definitions ==\n\nThe six trigonometric functions can be defined as coordinate values of points on the Euclidean plane that are related to the unit circle, which is the circle of radius one centered at the origin O of this coordinate system.

These values of the sine and the cosine may thus be constructed by ruler and compass.\nFor an angle of an integer number of degrees, the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of square roots and the cube root of a non-real complex number. Galois theory allows a proof that, if the angle is not a multiple of 3\u00b0, non-real cube roots are unavoidable.\nFor an angle which, expressed in degrees, is a rational number, the sine and the cosine are algebraic numbers, which may be expressed in terms of nth roots. This results from the fact that the Galois groups of the cyclotomic polynomials are cyclic.\nFor an angle which, expressed in degrees, is not a rational number, then either the angle or both the sine and the cosine are transcendental numbers. This is a corollary of Baker's theorem, proved in 1966.\n\n\n=== Simple algebraic values ===\n\nThe following table lists the sines, cosines, and tangents of multiples of 15 degrees from 0 to 90 degrees.\n\n\n== In calculus ==\n\nThe modern trend in mathematics is to build geometry from calculus rather than the converse. Therefore, except at a very elementary level, trigonometric functions are defined using the methods of calculus.\nTrigonometric functions are differentiable and analytic at every point where they are defined; that is, everywhere for the sine and the cosine, and, for the tangent, everywhere except at \u03c0/2 + k\u03c0 for every integer k.\nThe trigonometric function are periodic functions, and their primitive period is 2\u03c0 for the sine and the cosine, and \u03c0 for the tangent, which is increasing in each open interval (\u03c0/2 + k\u03c0, \u03c0/2 + (k + 1)\u03c0). At each end point of these intervals, the tangent function has a vertical asymptote.\nIn calculus, there are two equivalent definitions of trigonometric functions, either using power series or differential equations. These definitions are equivalent, as starting from one of them, it is easy to retrieve the other as a property. However the definition through differential equations is somehow more natural, since, for example, the choice of the coefficients of the power series may appear as quite arbitrary, and the Pythagorean identity is much easier to deduce from the differential equations.\n\n\n=== Definition by differential equations ===\nSine and cosine can be defined as the unique solution to the initial value problem:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        x\n        ,\n         \n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \u2212\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        x\n        ,\n         \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        0\n        )\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n         \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        0\n        )\n        =\n        1.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{dx}}\\sin x=\\cos x,\\ {\\frac {d}{dx}}\\cos x=-\\sin x,\\ \\sin(0)=0,\\ \\cos(0)=1.}\n  Differentiating again, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              d\n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \u2212\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {d^{2}}{dx^{2}}}\\sin x={\\frac {d}{dx}}\\cos x=-\\sin x}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              d\n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \u2212\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {d^{2}}{dx^{2}}}\\cos x=-{\\frac {d}{dx}}\\sin x=-\\cos x}\n  , so both sine and cosine are solutions of the ordinary differential equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \u2033\n        \n        +\n        y\n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y''+y=0.}\n  Applying the quotient rule to the tangent \n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        x\n        \n          /\n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan x=\\sin x/\\cos x}\n  , we derive\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                cos\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2061\n              x\n              +\n              \n                sin\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2061\n              x\n            \n            \n              \n                cos\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2061\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        +\n        \n          tan\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        x\n        =\n        \n          sec\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{dx}}\\tan x={\\frac {\\cos ^{2}x+\\sin ^{2}x}{\\cos ^{2}x}}=1+\\tan ^{2}x=\\sec ^{2}x.}\n  \n\n\n=== Power series expansion ===\nApplying the differential equations to power series with indeterminate coefficients, one may deduce recurrence relations for the coefficients of the Taylor series of the sine and cosine functions.

Therefore, the sine and the cosine can be extended to entire functions (also called \"sine\" and \"cosine\"), which are (by definition) complex-valued functions that are defined and holomorphic on the whole complex plane.\nBeing defined as fractions of entire functions, the other trigonometric functions may be extended to meromorphic functions, that is functions that are holomorphic in the whole complex plane, except some isolated points called poles. Here, the poles are the numbers of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        2\n        k\n        +\n        1\n        )\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle (2k+1){\\frac {\\pi }{2}}}\n   for the tangent and the secant, or \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k\\pi }\n   for the cotangent and the cosecant, where k is an arbitrary integer.\nRecurrences relations may also be computed for the coefficients of the Taylor series of the other trigonometric functions. These series have a finite radius of convergence. Their coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation: they enumerate alternating permutations of finite sets.More precisely, defining\n\nUn, the nth up/down number,\nBn, the nth Bernoulli number,

Various features unique to the complex functions can be seen from the graph; for example, the sine and cosine functions can be seen to be unbounded as the imaginary part of \n  \n    \n      \n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z}\n   becomes larger (since the color white represents infinity), and the fact that the functions contain simple zeros or poles is apparent from the fact that the hue cycles around each zero or pole exactly once.  Comparing these graphs with those of the corresponding Hyperbolic functions highlights the relationships between the two.\n\n\n== Basic identities ==\nMany identities interrelate the trigonometric functions. This section contains the most basic ones; for more identities, see List of trigonometric identities. These identities may be proved geometrically from the unit-circle definitions or the right-angled-triangle definitions (although, for the latter definitions, care must be taken for angles that are not in the interval [0, \u03c0/2], see Proofs of trigonometric identities). For non-geometrical proofs using only tools of calculus, one may use directly the differential equations, in a way that is similar to that of the above proof of Euler's identity. One can also use Euler's identity for expressing all trigonometric functions in terms of complex exponentials and using properties of the exponential function.\n\n\n=== Parity ===\nThe cosine and the secant are even functions; the other trigonometric functions are odd functions.

functions ==\n\nThe trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence not injective, so strictly speaking, they do not have an inverse function. However, on each interval on which a trigonometric function is monotonic, one can define an inverse function, and this defines inverse trigonometric functions as multivalued functions. To define a true inverse function, one must restrict the domain to an interval where the function is monotonic, and is thus bijective from this interval to its image by the function. The common choice for this interval, called the set of principal values, is given in the following table. As usual, the inverse trigonometric functions are denoted with the prefix \"arc\" before the name or its abbreviation of the function.\n\nThe notations sin\u22121, cos\u22121, etc. are often used for arcsin and arccos, etc. When this notation is used, inverse functions could be confused with multiplicative inverses. The notation with the \"arc\" prefix avoids such a confusion, though \"arcsec\" for arcsecant can be confused with \"arcsecond\".\nJust like the sine and cosine, the inverse trigonometric functions can also be expressed in terms of infinite series. They can also be expressed in terms of complex logarithms.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Angles and sides of a triangle ===\nIn this section A, B, C denote the three (interior) angles of a triangle, and a, b, c denote the lengths of the respective opposite edges. They are related by various formulas, which are named by the trigonometric functions they involve.\n\n\n==== Law of sines ====\n\nThe law of sines states that for an arbitrary triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles opposite those sides A, B and C:\n\nwhere \u0394 is the area of the triangle,\nor, equivalently,\n\nwhere R is the triangle's circumradius.\nIt can be proved by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the above definition of sine. The law of sines is useful for computing the lengths of the unknown sides in a triangle if two angles and one side are known. This is a common situation occurring in triangulation, a technique to determine unknown distances by measuring two angles and an accessible enclosed distance.\n\n\n==== Law of cosines ====\n\nThe law of cosines (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nor equivalently,\n\nIn this formula the angle at C is opposite to the side c. This theorem can be proved by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the Pythagorean theorem.\nThe law of cosines can be used to determine a side of a triangle if two sides and the angle between them are known.  It can also be used to find the cosines of an angle (and consequently the angles themselves) if the lengths of all the sides are known.\n\n\n==== Law of tangents ====\n\nThe law of tangents says that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              tan\n              \u2061\n              \n                \n                  \n                    A\n                    \u2212\n                    B\n                  \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              tan\n              \u2061\n              \n                \n                  \n                    A\n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \u2212\n              b\n            \n            \n              a\n              +\n              b\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\tan {\\frac {A-B}{2}}}{\\tan {\\frac {A+B}{2}}}}={\\frac {a-b}{a+b}}}\n  .\n\n\n==== Law of cotangents ====\n\nIf s is the triangle's semiperimeter, (a + b + c)/2, and r is the radius of the triangle's incircle, then rs is the triangle's area.

The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe simple harmonic motion, which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the pendular motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of uniform circular motion.\nTrigonometric functions also prove to be useful in the study of general periodic functions. The characteristic wave patterns of periodic functions are useful for modeling recurring phenomena such as sound or light waves.Under rather general conditions, a periodic function f\u200a(x) can be expressed as a sum of sine waves or cosine waves in a Fourier series. Denoting the sine or cosine basis functions by \u03c6k, the expansion of the periodic function f\u200a(t) takes the form:\n\nFor example, the square wave can be written as the Fourier series\n\nIn the animation of a square wave at top right it can be seen that just a few terms already produce a fairly good approximation. The superposition of several terms in the expansion of a sawtooth wave are shown underneath.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhile the early study of trigonometry can be traced to antiquity, the trigonometric functions as they are in use today were developed in the medieval period. The chord function was discovered by Hipparchus of Nicaea (180\u2013125 BCE) and Ptolemy of Roman Egypt (90\u2013165 CE). The functions of sine and versine (1 \u2013 cosine) can be traced back to the jy\u0101 and koti-jy\u0101 functions used in Gupta period Indian astronomy (Aryabhatiya, Surya Siddhanta), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin. (See Aryabhata's sine table.)\nAll six trigonometric functions in current use were known in Islamic mathematics by the 9th century, as was the law of sines, used in solving triangles. With the exception of the sine (which was adopted from Indian mathematics), the other five modern trigonometric functions were discovered by Persian and Arab mathematicians, including the cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant. Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (c.\u2009780\u2013850) produced tables of sines, cosines and tangents. Circa 830, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi discovered the cotangent, and produced tables of tangents and cotangents. Muhammad ibn J\u0101bir al-Harr\u0101n\u012b al-Batt\u0101n\u012b (853\u2013929) discovered the reciprocal functions of secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. The trigonometric functions were later studied by mathematicians including Omar Khayy\u00e1m, Bh\u0101skara II, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b (14th century), Ulugh Beg (14th century), Regiomontanus (1464), Rheticus, and Rheticus' student Valentinus Otho.\nMadhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1400) made early strides in the analysis of trigonometric functions in terms of infinite series. (See Madhava series and Madhava's sine table.)\nThe tangent function was brought to Europe by Giovanni Bianchini in 1467 in trigonometry tables he created to support the calculation of stellar coordinates.The terms tangent and secant were first introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fincke in his book Geometria rotundi (1583).The 17th century French mathematician Albert Girard made the first published use of the abbreviations sin, cos, and tan in his book Trigonom\u00e9trie.In a paper published in 1682, Gottfried Leibniz proved that sin x is not an algebraic function of x. Though introduced as ratios of sides of a right triangle, and thus appearing to be rational functions, Leibnitz result established that they are actually transcendental functions of their argument. The task of assimilating circular functions into algebraic expressions was accomplished by Euler in his Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite (1748). His method was to show that the sine and cosine functions are alternating series formed from the even and odd terms respectively of the exponential series. He presented \"Euler's formula\", as well as near-modern abbreviations (sin., cos., tang., cot., sec., and cosec.).A few functions were common historically, but are now seldom used, such as the chord, the versine (which appeared in the earliest tables), the coversine, the haversine, the exsecant and the excosecant. The list of trigonometric identities shows more relations between these functions.\n\ncrd(\u03b8) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2)\nversin(\u03b8) = 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8) = 2 sin2(\u03b8/2)\ncoversin(\u03b8) = 1 \u2212 sin(\u03b8) = versin(\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8)\nhaversin(\u03b8) = 1/2versin(\u03b8) = sin2(\u03b8/2)\nexsec(\u03b8) = sec(\u03b8) \u2212 1\nexcsc(\u03b8) = exsec(\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8) = csc(\u03b8) \u2212 1\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word sine derives from Latin sinus, meaning \"bend; bay\", and more specifically \"the hanging fold of the upper part of a toga\", \"the bosom of a garment\", which was chosen as the translation of what was interpreted as the Arabic word jaib, meaning \"pocket\" or \"fold\" in the twelfth-century translations of works by Al-Battani and al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b into Medieval Latin.\nThe choice was based on a misreading of the Arabic written form j-y-b (\u062c\u064a\u0628), which itself originated as a transliteration from Sanskrit j\u012bv\u0101, which along with its synonym jy\u0101  (the standard Sanskrit term for the sine) translates to \"bowstring\", being in turn adopted from Ancient Greek \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03ae \"string\".The word tangent comes from Latin tangens meaning \"touching\", since the line touches the circle of unit radius, whereas secant stems from Latin secans\u2014\"cutting\"\u2014since the line cuts the circle.The prefix \"co-\" (in \"cosine\", \"cotangent\", \"cosecant\") is found in Edmund Gunter's Canon triangulorum (1620), which defines the cosinus as an abbreviation for the sinus complementi (sine of the complementary angle) and proceeds to define the cotangens similarly.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Trigonometric functions\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nVisionlearning Module on Wave Mathematics\nGonioLab Visualization of the unit circle, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions\nq-Sine Article about the q-analog of sin at MathWorld\nq-Cosine Article about the q-analog of cos at MathWorld", "Arc_length": "Arc length is the distance between two points along a section of a curve.\nDetermining the length of an irregular arc segment by approximating the arc segment as connected (straight) line segments is also called curve rectification.

Since it is straightforward to calculate the length of each linear segment (using the Pythagorean theorem in Euclidean space, for example), the total length of the approximation can be found by summation of the lengths of each linear segment; that approximation is known as the (cumulative) chordal distance.If the curve is not already a polygonal path, then using a progressively larger number of line segments of smaller lengths will result in better curve length approximations. Such a curve length determination by approximating the curve as connected (straight) line segments is called rectification of a curve. The lengths of the successive approximations will not decrease and may keep increasing indefinitely, but for smooth curves they will tend to a finite limit as the lengths of the segments get arbitrarily small.\nFor some curves, there is a smallest number \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n   that is an upper bound on the length of all polygonal approximations (rectification).

Those are the numbers of the corresponding angle units in one complete turn.\nThose definitions of the metre and the nautical mile have been superseded by more precise ones, but the original definitions are still accurate enough for conceptual purposes and some calculations. For example, they imply that one kilometre is exactly 0.54 nautical miles. Using official modern definitions, one nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kilometres, which implies that 1 kilometre is about 0.53995680 nautical miles. This modern ratio differs from the one calculated from the original definitions by less than one part in 10,000.\n\n\n=== Other simple cases ===\nArchimedean spiral \u00a7 Arc length\nCycloid \u00a7 Arc length\nEllipse \u00a7 Arc length\nHelix \u00a7 Arc length\nParabola \u00a7 Arc length\nSine and cosine \u00a7 Arc length\nTriangle wave \u00a7 Arc length\n\n\n== Historical methods ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nFor much of the history of mathematics, even the greatest thinkers considered it impossible to compute the length of an irregular arc. Although Archimedes had pioneered a way of finding the area beneath a curve with his \"method of exhaustion\", few believed it was even possible for curves to have definite lengths, as do straight lines. The first ground was broken in this field, as it often has been in calculus, by approximation. People began to inscribe polygons within the curves and compute the length of the sides for a somewhat accurate measurement of the length. By using more segments, and by decreasing the length of each segment, they were able to obtain a more and more accurate approximation. In particular, by inscribing a polygon of many sides in a circle, they were able to find approximate values of \u03c0.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nIn the 17th century, the method of exhaustion led to the rectification by geometrical methods of several transcendental curves: the logarithmic spiral by Evangelista Torricelli in 1645 (some sources say John Wallis in the 1650s), the cycloid by Christopher Wren in 1658, and the catenary by Gottfried Leibniz in 1691.\nIn 1659, Wallis credited William Neile's discovery of the first rectification of a nontrivial algebraic curve, the semicubical parabola. The accompanying figures appear on page 145. On page 91, William Neile is mentioned as Gulielmus Nelius.\n\n\n=== Integral form ===\nBefore the full formal development of calculus, the basis for the modern integral form for arc length was independently discovered by Hendrik van Heuraet and Pierre de Fermat.\nIn 1659 van Heuraet published a construction showing that the problem of determining arc length could be transformed into the problem of determining the area under a curve (i.e., an integral).  As an example of his method, he determined the arc length of a semicubical parabola, which required finding the area under a parabola.  In 1660, Fermat published a more general theory containing the same result in his De linearum curvarum cum lineis rectis comparatione dissertatio geometrica (Geometric dissertation on curved lines in comparison with straight lines).\n\nBuilding on his previous work with tangents, Fermat used the curve\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            \n              3\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=x^{\\frac {3}{2}}\\,}\n  whose tangent at x = a had a slope of\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            3\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {3 \\over 2}a^{\\frac {1}{2}}}\n  so the tangent line would have the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \n          \n            3\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        a\n        )\n        +\n        f\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y={3 \\over 2}a^{\\frac {1}{2}}(x-a)+f(a).}\n  Next, he increased a by a small amount to a + \u03b5, making segment AC a relatively good approximation for the length of the curve from A to D. To find the length of the segment AC, he used the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                \n                  C\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                A\n                \n                  B\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                +\n                B\n                \n                  C\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \u03b5\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                +\n                \n                  \n                    9\n                    4\n                  \n                \n                a\n                \n                  \u03b5\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \u03b5\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    1\n                    +\n                    \n                      \n                        9\n                        4\n                      \n                    \n                    a\n                  \n                  )\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}AC^{2}&=AB^{2}+BC^{2}\\\\&=\\varepsilon ^{2}+{9 \\over 4}a\\varepsilon ^{2}\\\\&=\\varepsilon ^{2}\\left(1+{9 \\over 4}a\\right)\\end{aligned}}}\n  which, when solved, yields\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        C\n        =\n        \u03b5\n        \n          \n            1\n            +\n            \n              \n                9\n                4\n              \n            \n            a\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AC=\\varepsilon {\\sqrt {1+{9 \\over 4}a\\,}}.}\n  In order to approximate the length, Fermat would sum up a sequence of short segments.\n\n\n== Curves with infinite length ==\n\n \nAs mentioned above, some curves are non-rectifiable. That is, there is no upper bound on the lengths of polygonal approximations; the length can be made arbitrarily large. Informally, such curves are said to have infinite length. There are continuous curves on which every arc (other than a single-point arc) has infinite length. An example of such a curve is the Koch curve. Another example of a curve with infinite length is the graph of the function defined by f(x) = x sin(1/x) for any open set with 0 as one of its delimiters and f(0) = 0. Sometimes the Hausdorff dimension and Hausdorff measure are used to quantify the size of such curves.\n\n\n== Generalization to (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n   be a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        :\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ]\n        \u2192\n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma :[0,1]\\rightarrow M}\n   a curve in \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g}\n   the (pseudo-) metric tensor.\nThe length of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   is defined to be\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b3\n          \u2032\n        \n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \u2208\n        \n          T\n          \n            \u03b3\n            (\n            t\n            )\n          \n        \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma '(t)\\in T_{\\gamma (t)}M}\n   is the tangent vector of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   at \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t.}\n    The sign in the square root is chosen once for a given curve, to ensure that the square root is a real number. The positive sign is chosen for spacelike curves; in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the negative sign may be chosen for timelike curves. Thus the length of a curve is a non-negative real number. Usually no curves are considered which are partly spacelike and partly timelike.\nIn theory of relativity, arc length of timelike curves (world lines) is the proper time elapsed along the world line, and arc length of a spacelike curve the proper distance along the curve.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArc (geometry)\nCircumference\nCrofton formula\nElliptic integral\nGeodesics\nIntrinsic equation\nIntegral approximations\nLine integral\nMeridian arc\nMultivariable calculus\nSinuosity\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nFarouki, Rida T.

It is concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\nUntil the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts.During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is Carl Friedrich Gauss' Theorema Egregiumcode: lat promoted to code: la  (\"remarkable theorem\") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry.\nLater in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry.\nSince then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods\u2014differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.\u2014or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded\u2014projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others.\nThis enlargement of the scope of geometry led to a change of meaning of the word \"space\", which originally referred to the three-dimensional space of the physical world and its model provided by Euclidean geometry; presently a geometric space, or simply a space is a mathematical structure on which some geometry is defined.\nOriginally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt in the 2nd millennium BC. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. The earliest known texts on geometry are the Egyptian Rhind Papyrus (2000\u20131800 BC) and Moscow Papyrus (c.\u20091890 BC), and the Babylonian clay tablets, such as Plimpton 322 (1900 BC). For example, the Moscow Papyrus gives a formula for calculating the volume of a truncated pyramid, or frustum. Later clay tablets (350\u201350 BC) demonstrate that Babylonian astronomers implemented trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and motion within time-velocity space. These geometric procedures anticipated the Oxford Calculators, including the mean speed theorem, by 14 centuries. South of Egypt the ancient Nubians established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks.In the 7th century BC, the Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore.  He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales's theorem. Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, which is credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem, though the statement of the theorem has a long history. Eudoxus (408\u2013c.\u2009355 BC) developed the method of exhaustion, which allowed the calculation of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures, as well as a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of incommensurable magnitudes, which enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time, introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today. Archimedes (c.\u2009287\u2013212 BC) of Syracuse, Italy used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave remarkably accurate approximations of pi. He also studied the spiral bearing his name and obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution.\n\nIndian mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The Shatapatha Brahmana (3rd century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba Sutras. According to (Hayashi 2005, p. 363), the \u015aulba S\u016btras contain \"the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians. They contain lists of Pythagorean triples, which are particular cases of Diophantine equations.\nIn the Bakhshali manuscript, there are a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also \"employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero.\" Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya (499) includes the computation of areas and volumes.\nBrahmagupta wrote his astronomical work Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 Sanskrit verses, was divided into two sections: \"basic operations\" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and \"practical mathematics\" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain). In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of Heron's formula), as well as a complete description of rational triangles (i.e. triangles with rational sides and rational areas).In the Middle Ages, mathematics in medieval Islam contributed to the development of geometry, especially algebraic geometry. Al-Mahani (b. 853) conceived the idea of reducing geometrical problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra. Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra (known as Thebit in Latin) (836\u2013901) dealt with arithmetic operations applied to ratios of geometrical quantities, and contributed to the development of analytic geometry. Omar Khayyam (1048\u20131131) found geometric solutions to cubic equations.  The theorems of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), Omar Khayyam and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi on quadrilaterals, including the Lambert quadrilateral and Saccheri quadrilateral, were early results in hyperbolic geometry, and along with their alternative postulates, such as Playfair's axiom, these works had a considerable influence on the development of non-Euclidean geometry among later European geometers, including Vitello (c.\u20091230 \u2013 c.\u20091314), Gersonides (1288\u20131344), Alfonso, John Wallis, and Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri.In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with coordinates and equations, by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601\u20131665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of calculus and a precise quantitative science of physics. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of projective geometry by Girard Desargues (1591\u20131661). Projective geometry studies properties of shapes which are unchanged under projections and sections, especially as they relate to artistic perspective.Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been studied previously. These were the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, J\u00e1nos Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss and of the formulation of symmetry as the central consideration in the Erlangen programme of Felix Klein (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were Bernhard Riemann (1826\u20131866), working primarily with tools from mathematical analysis, and introducing the Riemann surface, and Henri Poincar\u00e9, the founder of algebraic topology and the geometric theory of dynamical systems. As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of \"space\" became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as complex analysis and classical mechanics.\n\n\n== Main concepts ==\nThe following are some of the most important concepts in geometry.\n\n\n=== Axioms ===\n\nEuclid took an abstract approach to geometry in his Elements, one of the most influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain axioms, or postulates, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as axiomatic or synthetic geometry. At the start of the 19th century, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky (1792\u20131856), J\u00e1nos Bolyai (1802\u20131860), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) and others led to a revival of interest in this discipline, and in the 20th century, David Hilbert (1862\u20131943) employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry.\n\n\n=== Objects ===\n\n\n==== Points ====\n\nPoints are generally considered fundamental objects for building geometry. They may be defined by the properties that they must have, as in Euclid's definition as \"that which has no part\", or in synthetic geometry. In modern mathematics, they are generally defined as elements of a set called space, which is itself axiomatically defined.\nWith these modern definitions, every geometric shape is defined as a set of points; this is not the case in synthetic geometry, where a line is another fundamental object that is not viewed as the set of the points through which it passes.\nHowever, there are modern geometries in which points are not primitive objects, or even without points. One of the oldest such geometries is Whitehead's point-free geometry, formulated by Alfred North Whitehead in 1919\u20131920.\n\n\n==== Lines ====\n\nEuclid described a line as \"breadthless length\" which \"lies equally with respect to the points on itself\". In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it. In differential geometry, a geodesic is a generalization of the notion of a line to curved spaces.\n\n\n==== Planes ====\n\nIn Euclidean geometry a plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely; the definitions for other types of geometries are generalizations of that. Planes are used in many areas of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied as a topological surface without reference to distances or angles; it can be studied as an affine space, where collinearity and ratios can be studied but not distances; it can be studied as the complex plane using techniques of complex analysis; and so on.\n\n\n==== Angles ====\n\nEuclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, angles are used to study polygons and triangles, as well as forming an object of study in their own right. The study of the angles of a triangle or of angles in a unit circle forms the basis of trigonometry.In differential geometry and calculus, the angles between plane curves or space curves or surfaces can be calculated using the derivative.\n\n\n==== Curves ====\n\nA curve is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not; curves in 2-dimensional space are called plane curves and those in 3-dimensional space are called space curves.In topology, a curve is defined by a function from an interval of the real numbers to another space. In differential geometry, the same definition is used, but the defining function is required to be differentiable  Algebraic geometry studies algebraic curves, which are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one.\n\n\n==== Surfaces ====\n\nA surface is a two-dimensional object, such as a sphere or paraboloid. In differential geometry and topology, surfaces are described by two-dimensional 'patches' (or neighborhoods) that are assembled by diffeomorphisms or homeomorphisms, respectively. In algebraic geometry, surfaces are described by polynomial equations.\n\n\n==== Manifolds ====\n\nA manifold is a generalization of the concepts of curve and surface. In topology, a manifold is a topological space where every point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. In differential geometry, a differentiable manifold is a space where each neighborhood is diffeomorphic to Euclidean space.Manifolds are used extensively in physics, including in general relativity and string theory.\n\n\n=== Length, area, and volume ===\n\nLength, area, and volume describe the size or extent of an object in one dimension, two dimension, and three dimensions respectively.In Euclidean geometry and analytic geometry, the length of a line segment can often be calculated by the Pythagorean theorem.Area and volume can be defined as fundamental quantities separate from length, or they can be described and calculated in terms of lengths in a plane or 3-dimensional space. Mathematicians have found many explicit formulas for area and formulas for volume of various geometric objects. In calculus, area and volume can be defined in terms of integrals, such as the Riemann integral or the Lebesgue integral.\n\n\n==== Metrics and measures ====\n\nThe concept of length or distance can be generalized, leading to the idea of metrics. For instance, the Euclidean metric measures the distance between points in the Euclidean plane, while the hyperbolic metric measures the distance in the hyperbolic plane. Other important examples of metrics include the Lorentz metric of special relativity and the semi-Riemannian metrics of general relativity.In a different direction, the concepts of length, area and volume are extended by measure theory, which studies methods of assigning a size or measure to sets, where the measures follow rules similar to those of classical area and volume.\n\n\n=== Congruence and similarity ===\n\nCongruence and similarity are concepts that describe when two shapes have similar characteristics. In Euclidean geometry, similarity is used to describe objects that have the same shape, while congruence is used to describe objects that are the same in both size and shape. Hilbert, in his work on creating a more rigorous foundation for geometry, treated congruence as an undefined term whose properties are defined by axioms.\nCongruence and similarity are generalized in transformation geometry, which studies the properties of geometric objects that are preserved by different kinds of transformations.\n\n\n=== Compass and straightedge constructions ===\n\nClassical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments used in most geometric constructions are the compass and straightedge. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using neusis, parabolas and other curves, or mechanical devices, were found.\n\n\n=== Dimension ===\n\nWhere the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a line), 2 (a plane) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as three-dimensional space), mathematicians and physicists have used higher dimensions for nearly two centuries. One example of a mathematical use for higher dimensions is the configuration space of a physical system, which has a dimension equal to the system's degrees of freedom. For instance, the configuration of a screw can be described by five coordinates.In general topology, the concept of dimension has been extended from natural numbers, to infinite dimension (Hilbert spaces, for example) and  positive real numbers (in fractal geometry). In algebraic geometry, the dimension of an algebraic variety has received a number of apparently different definitions, which are all equivalent in the most common cases.\n\n\n=== Symmetry ===\n\nThe theme of symmetry in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the circle, regular polygons and platonic solids held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of Leonardo da Vinci, M. C. Escher, and others. In the second half of the 19th century, the relationship between symmetry and geometry came under intense scrutiny. Felix Klein's Erlangen program proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation group, determines what geometry is. Symmetry in classical Euclidean geometry is represented by congruences and rigid motions, whereas in projective geometry an analogous role is played by collineations, geometric transformations that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, Clifford and Klein, and Sophus Lie that Klein's idea to 'define a geometry via its symmetry group' found its inspiration. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in topology and geometric group theory, the latter in Lie theory and Riemannian geometry.A different type of symmetry is the principle of duality  in projective geometry, among other fields. This meta-phenomenon can roughly be described as follows: in any theorem, exchange point with plane, join with meet, lies in with contains, and the result is an equally true theorem. A similar and closely related form of duality exists between a vector space and its dual space.\n\n\n== Contemporary geometry ==\n\n\n=== Euclidean geometry ===\n\nEuclidean geometry is geometry in its classical sense. As it models the space of the physical world, it is used in many scientific areas, such as mechanics, astronomy, crystallography, and many technical fields, such as engineering, architecture, geodesy, aerodynamics, and navigation. The mandatory educational curriculum of the majority of nations includes the study of Euclidean concepts such as points, lines, planes, angles, triangles, congruence, similarity, solid figures, circles, and analytic geometry.\n\n\n=== Differential geometry ===\n\nDifferential geometry uses techniques of calculus and linear algebra to study problems in geometry. It has applications in physics, econometrics, and bioinformatics, among others.\nIn particular, differential geometry is of importance to mathematical physics due to Albert Einstein's general relativity postulation that the universe is curved. Differential geometry can either be intrinsic (meaning that the spaces it considers are smooth manifolds whose geometric structure is governed by a Riemannian metric, which determines how distances are measured near each point) or extrinsic (where the object under study is a part of some ambient flat Euclidean space).\n\n\n==== Non-Euclidean geometry ====\n\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nTopology is the field concerned with the properties of continuous mappings, and can be considered a generalization of Euclidean geometry. In practice, topology often means dealing with large-scale properties of spaces, such as connectedness and compactness.The field of topology, which saw massive development in the 20th century, is in a technical sense a type of transformation geometry, in which transformations are homeomorphisms. This has often been expressed in the form of the saying 'topology is rubber-sheet geometry'. Subfields of topology include geometric topology, differential topology, algebraic topology and general topology.\n\n\n=== Algebraic geometry ===\n\nThe field of algebraic geometry developed from the Cartesian geometry of co-ordinates. It underwent periodic periods of growth, accompanied by the creation and study of projective geometry, birational geometry, algebraic varieties, and commutative algebra, among other topics. From the late 1950s through the mid-1970s it had undergone major foundational development, largely due to work of Jean-Pierre Serre and Alexander Grothendieck. This led to the introduction of schemes and greater emphasis on topological methods, including various cohomology theories. One of seven Millennium Prize problems, the Hodge conjecture, is a question in algebraic geometry. Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem uses advanced methods of algebraic geometry for solving a long-standing problem of number theory.\nIn general, algebraic geometry studies geometry through the use of concepts in commutative algebra such as multivariate polynomials. It has applications in many areas, including cryptography and string theory.\n\n\n=== Complex geometry ===\n\nComplex geometry studies the nature of geometric structures modelled on, or arising out of, the complex plane. Complex geometry lies at the intersection of differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and analysis of several complex variables, and has found applications to string theory and mirror symmetry.Complex geometry first appeared as a distinct area of study in the work of Bernhard Riemann in his study of Riemann surfaces. Work in the spirit of Riemann was carried out by the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the early 1900s. Contemporary treatment of complex geometry began with the work of Jean-Pierre Serre, who introduced the concept of sheaves to the subject, and illuminated the relations between complex geometry and algebraic geometry.\nThe primary objects of study in complex geometry are complex manifolds, complex algebraic varieties, and complex analytic varieties, and holomorphic vector bundles and coherent sheaves over these spaces. Special examples of spaces studied in complex geometry include Riemann surfaces, and Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, and these spaces find uses in string theory. In particular, worldsheets of strings are modelled by Riemann surfaces, and superstring theory predicts that the extra 6 dimensions of 10 dimensional spacetime may be modelled by Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds.\n\n\n=== Discrete geometry ===\n\nDiscrete geometry is a subject that has close connections with convex geometry. It is concerned mainly with questions of relative position of simple geometric objects, such as points, lines and circles. Examples include the study of sphere packings, triangulations, the Kneser-Poulsen conjecture, etc. It shares many methods and principles with combinatorics.\n\n\n=== Computational geometry ===\n\nComputational geometry deals with algorithms and their implementations for manipulating geometrical objects. Important problems historically have included the travelling salesman problem, minimum spanning trees, hidden-line removal, and linear programming.Although being a young area of geometry, it has many applications in computer vision, image processing, computer-aided design, medical imaging, etc.\n\n\n=== Geometric group theory ===\n\nGeometric group theory uses large-scale geometric techniques to study finitely generated groups. It is closely connected to low-dimensional topology, such as in Grigori Perelman's proof of the Geometrization conjecture, which included the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, a Millennium Prize Problem.Geometric group theory often revolves around the Cayley graph, which is a geometric representation of a group. Other important topics include quasi-isometries, Gromov-hyperbolic groups, and right angled Artin groups.\n\n\n=== Convex geometry ===\n\nConvex geometry investigates convex shapes in the Euclidean space and its more abstract analogues, often using techniques of real analysis and discrete mathematics. It has close connections to convex analysis, optimization and functional analysis and important applications in number theory.\nConvex geometry dates back to antiquity. Archimedes gave the first known precise definition of convexity. The isoperimetric problem, a recurring concept in convex geometry, was studied by the Greeks as well, including Zenodorus. Archimedes, Plato, Euclid, and later Kepler and Coxeter all studied convex polytopes and their properties. From the 19th century on, mathematicians have studied other areas of convex mathematics, including higher-dimensional polytopes, volume and surface area of convex bodies, Gaussian curvature, algorithms, tilings and lattices.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nGeometry has found applications in many fields, some of which are described below.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. For instance, the theory of perspective showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric properties of figures: perspective is the origin of projective geometry.Artists have long used concepts of proportion in design. Vitruvius developed a complicated theory of ideal proportions for the human figure. These concepts have been used and adapted by artists from Michelangelo to modern comic book artists.The golden ratio is a particular proportion that has had a controversial role in art. Often claimed to be the most aesthetically pleasing ratio of lengths, it is frequently stated to be incorporated into famous works of art, though the most reliable and unambiguous examples were made deliberately by artists aware of this legend.Tilings, or tessellations, have been used in art throughout history. Islamic art makes frequent use of tessellations, as did the art of M. C. Escher. Escher's work also made use of hyperbolic geometry.\nC\u00e9zanne advanced the theory that all images can be built up from the sphere, the cone, and the cylinder. This is still used in art theory today, although the exact list of shapes varies from author to author.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nGeometry has many applications in architecture. In fact, it has been said that geometry lies at the core of architectural design. Applications of geometry to architecture include the use of projective geometry to create forced perspective, the use of conic sections in constructing domes and similar objects, the use of tessellations, and the use of symmetry.\n\n\n=== Physics ===\n\nThe field of astronomy, especially as it relates to mapping the positions of stars and planets on the celestial sphere and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, have served as an important source of geometric problems throughout history.Riemannian geometry and pseudo-Riemannian geometry are used in general relativity. String theory makes use of several variants of geometry, as does quantum information theory.\n\n\n=== Other fields of mathematics ===\n\nCalculus was strongly influenced by geometry. For instance, the introduction of coordinates by Ren\u00e9 Descartes and the concurrent developments of algebra marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric figures such as plane curves could now be represented analytically in the form of functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of infinitesimal calculus in the 17th century. Analytic geometry continues to be a mainstay of pre-calculus and calculus curriculum.Another important area of application is number theory. In ancient Greece the Pythagoreans considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery of incommensurable lengths contradicted their philosophical views. Since the 19th century, geometry has been used for solving problems in number theory, for example through the geometry of numbers or, more recently, scheme theory, which is used in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nListsList of geometers\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:Differential geometers\nCategory:Geometers\nCategory:Topologists\nList of formulas in elementary geometry\nList of geometry topics\nList of important publications in geometry\nLists of mathematics topicsRelated topicsDescriptive geometry\nFinite geometry\nFlatland, a book written by Edwin Abbott Abbott about two- and three-dimensional space, to understand the concept of four dimensions\nGeometric space\nList of interactive geometry softwareOther applicationsMolecular geometry\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBoyer, C.B.

If a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles. The term is a calque of Latin angulus rectus; here rectus means \"upright\", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.\nClosely related and important geometrical concepts are perpendicular lines, meaning lines that form right angles at their point of intersection, and orthogonality, which is the property of forming right angles, usually applied to vectors. The presence of a right angle in a triangle is the defining factor for right triangles, making the right angle basic to trigonometry.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe meaning of right in right angle possibly refers to the Latin adjective rectus 'erect, straight, upright, perpendicular'. A Greek equivalent is orthos 'straight; perpendicular' (see orthogonality).\n\n\n== In elementary geometry ==\nA rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles.  A square has four right angles, in addition to equal-length sides.\nThe Pythagorean theorem states how to determine when a triangle is a right triangle.\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nIn Unicode, the symbol for a right angle is U+221F \u221f RIGHT ANGLE (&angrt;). It should not be confused with the similarly shaped symbol U+231E \u231e BOTTOM LEFT CORNER (&dlcorn;, &llcorner;). Related symbols are U+22BE \u22be RIGHT ANGLE WITH ARC (&angrtvb;), U+299C \u299c RIGHT ANGLE VARIANT WITH SQUARE (&vangrt;), and U+299D \u299d MEASURED RIGHT ANGLE WITH DOT (&angrtvbd;).In diagrams, the fact that an angle is a right angle is usually expressed by adding a small right angle that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right. The symbol for a measured angle, an arc, with a dot, is used in some European countries, including German-speaking countries and Poland, as an alternative symbol for a right angle.\n\n\n== Euclid ==\nRight angles are fundamental in Euclid's Elements. They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines.  Definition 10 does not use numerical degree measurements but rather touches at the very heart of what a right angle is, namely two straight lines intersecting to form two equal and adjacent angles.  The straight lines which form right angles are called perpendicular.  Euclid uses right angles in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those smaller than a right angle) and obtuse angles (those greater than a right angle). Two angles are called complementary if their sum is a right angle.Book 1 Postulate 4 states that all right angles are equal, which allows Euclid to use a right angle as a unit to measure other angles with. Euclid's commentator Proclus gave a proof of this postulate using the previous postulates, but it may be argued that this proof makes use of some hidden assumptions. Saccheri gave a proof as well but using a more explicit assumption. In Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry this statement is given as a theorem, but only after much groundwork. One may argue that, even if postulate 4 can be proven from the preceding ones, in the order that Euclid presents his material it is necessary to include it since without it postulate 5, which uses the right angle as a unit of measure, makes no sense.\n\n\n== Conversion to other units ==\nA right angle may be expressed in different units:\n\n1/4 turn\n90\u00b0 (degrees)\n\u03c0/2 radians\n100 grad (also called grade, gradian, or gon)\n8 points (of a 32-point compass rose)\n6 hours (astronomical hour angle)\n\n\n== Rule of 3-4-5 ==\nThroughout history, carpenters and masons have known a quick way to confirm if an angle is a true \"right angle\". It is based on the most widely known Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5) and so called the \"rule of 3-4-5\". From the angle in question, running a straight line along one side exactly 3 units in length, and along the second side exactly 4 units in length, will create a hypotenuse (the longer line opposite the right angle that connects the two measured endpoints) of exactly 5 units in length. This measurement can be made quickly and without technical instruments. The geometric law behind the measurement is the Pythagorean theorem (\"The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides\").\n\n\n== Thales' theorem ==\n\nThales' theorem states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle (with a vertex on the semicircle and its defining rays going through the endpoints of the semicircle) is a right angle.\nTwo application examples in which the right angle and the Thales' theorem are included (see animations).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCartesian coordinate system\nTypes of angles\n\n\n== References ==\n\nWentworth, G.A.

Heath Elements Vol. 1 (1908 Cambridge) Google Books", "Sine": "In mathematics, sine and cosine are trigonometric functions of an angle. The sine and cosine of an acute angle are defined in the context of a right triangle: for the specified angle, its sine is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse), and the cosine is the ratio of the length of the adjacent leg to that of the hypotenuse. For an angle \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  , the sine and cosine functions are denoted simply as \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta }\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos \\theta }\n  .More generally, the definitions of sine and cosine can be extended to any real value in terms of the lengths of certain line segments in a unit circle. More modern definitions express the sine and cosine as infinite series, or as the solutions of certain differential equations, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to complex numbers.\nThe sine and cosine functions are commonly used to model periodic phenomena such as sound and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year. They can be traced to the jy\u0101 and ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101 functions used in Indian astronomy during the Gupta period.\n\n\n== Notation ==\n\nSine and cosine are written using functional notation with the abbreviations sin and cos.\nOften, if the argument is simple enough, the function value will be written without parentheses, as sin \u03b8 rather than as sin(\u03b8).\nEach of sine and cosine is a function of an angle, which is usually expressed in terms of radians or degrees.  Except where explicitly stated otherwise, this article assumes that the angle is measured in radians.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== Right-angled triangle definitions ===\n\nTo define the sine and cosine of an acute angle \u03b1, start with a right triangle that contains an angle of measure \u03b1; in the accompanying figure, angle \u03b1 in triangle ABC is the angle of interest. The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:\n\nThe opposite side is the side opposite to the angle of interest, in this case side a.\nThe hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side h. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.\nThe adjacent side is the remaining side, in this case side b. It forms a side of (and is adjacent to) both the angle of interest (angle A) and the right angle.Once such a triangle is chosen, the sine of the angle is equal to the length of the opposite side, divided by the length of the hypotenuse:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              opposite\n            \n            \n              hypotenuse\n            \n          \n        \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              adjacent\n            \n            \n              hypotenuse\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(\\alpha )={\\frac {\\textrm {opposite}}{\\textrm {hypotenuse}}}\\qquad \\cos(\\alpha )={\\frac {\\textrm {adjacent}}{\\textrm {hypotenuse}}}}\n  The other trigonometric functions of the angle can be defined similarly; for example, the tangent is the ratio between the opposite and adjacent sides.As stated, the values \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(\\alpha )}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos(\\alpha )}\n   appear to depend on the choice of right triangle containing an angle of measure \u03b1. However, this is not the case: all such triangles are similar, and so the ratios are the same for each of them.\n\n\n=== Unit circle definitions ===\nIn trigonometry, a unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nLet a line through the origin intersect the unit circle, making an angle of \u03b8 with the positive half of the x-axis. The x- and y-coordinates of this point of intersection are equal to cos(\u03b8) and sin(\u03b8), respectively. This definition is consistent with the right-angled triangle definition of sine and cosine when \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        <\n        \u03b8\n        <\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0<\\theta <{\\frac {\\pi }{2}}}\n  : because the length of the hypotenuse of the unit circle is always 1, \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            opposite\n            hypotenuse\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            opposite\n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          opposite\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(\\theta )={\\frac {\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}}={\\frac {\\text{opposite}}{1}}={\\text{opposite}}}\n  .

Using only geometry and properties of limits, it can be shown that the derivative of sine is cosine, and that the derivative of cosine is the negative of sine.  This means the successive derivatives of sin(x) are cos(x), -sin(x), -cos(x), sin(x), continuing to repeat those four functions.

The inverse function of cosine is arccosine (arccos, acos, or cos\u22121). (The superscript of \u22121 in sin\u22121 and cos\u22121 denotes the inverse of a function, not exponentiation.) As sine and cosine are not injective, their inverses are not exact inverse functions, but partial inverse functions. For example, sin(0) = 0, but also sin(\u03c0) = 0, sin(2\u03c0) = 0 etc. It follows that the arcsine function is multivalued: arcsin(0) = 0, but also arcsin(0) = \u03c0, arcsin(0) = 2\u03c0, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its principal branch. With this restriction, for each x in the domain, the expression arcsin(x) will evaluate only to a single value, called its principal value.  The standard range of principal values for arcsin is from \u2212\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2 and the standard range for arccos is from 0 to \u03c0.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        =\n

The chord function was discovered by Hipparchus of Nicaea (180\u2013125 BCE) and Ptolemy of Roman Egypt (90\u2013165 CE). See in particular Ptolemy's table of chords.\nThe sine and cosine functions can be traced to the jy\u0101 and ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101 functions used in Indian astronomy during the Gupta period (Aryabhatiya and Surya Siddhanta), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.All six trigonometric functions in current use were known in Islamic mathematics by the 9th century, as was the law of sines, used in solving triangles. With the exception of the sine (which was adopted from Indian mathematics), the other five modern trigonometric functions were discovered by Arabic mathematicians, including the cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant. Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (c.\u2009780\u2013850) produced tables of sines, cosines and tangents. Muhammad ibn J\u0101bir al-Harr\u0101n\u012b al-Batt\u0101n\u012b (853\u2013929) discovered the reciprocal functions of secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.The first published use of the abbreviations sin, cos, and tan is by the 16th-century French mathematician Albert Girard; these were further promulgated by Euler (see below). The Opus palatinum de triangulis of Georg Joachim Rheticus, a student of Copernicus, was probably the first in Europe to define trigonometric functions directly in terms of right triangles instead of circles, with tables for all six trigonometric functions; this work was finished by Rheticus' student Valentin Otho in 1596.\nIn a paper published in 1682, Leibniz proved that sin x is not an algebraic function of x. Roger Cotes computed the derivative of sine in his Harmonia Mensurarum (1722). Leonhard Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) was mostly responsible for establishing the analytic treatment of trigonometric functions in Europe, also defining them as infinite series and presenting \"Euler's formula\", as well as the near-modern abbreviations sin., cos., tang., cot., sec., and cosec.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nEtymologically, the word sine derives from the Sanskrit word jy\u0101 'bow-string'  \nor more specifically its synonym j\u012bv\u00e1 (both adopted from Ancient Greek \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03ae 'string'), due to visual similarity between the arc of a circle with its corresponding chord and a bow with its string (see jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101 and utkrama-jy\u0101). This was transliterated in Arabic as j\u012bba, which is however meaningless in that language and abbreviated jb (\u062c\u0628). Since Arabic is written without short vowels, jb was interpreted as the homograph jaib, jayb (\u062c\u064a\u0628), which means 'bosom', 'pocket', 'fold'. When the Arabic texts of Al-Battani and al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b were translated into Medieval Latin in the 12th century by Gerard of Cremona, he used the Latin equivalent sinus (which also means 'bay' or 'fold', and more specifically 'the hanging fold of a toga over the breast'). Gerard was probably not the first scholar to use this translation; Robert of Chester appears to have preceded him and there is evidence of even earlier usage. The English form sine was introduced in the 1590s.The word cosine derives from an abbreviation of the Latin complementi sinus 'sine of the complementary angle' as cosinus in Edmund Gunter's Canon triangulorum (1620), which also includes a similar definition of cotangens.\n\n\n== Software implementations ==\n\nThere is no standard algorithm for calculating sine and cosine. IEEE 754, the most widely used standard for the specification of reliable floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine. The reason is that no efficient algorithm is known for computing sine and cosine with a specified accuracy, especially for large inputs.Algorithms for calculating sine may be balanced for such constraints as speed, accuracy, portability, or range of input values accepted. This can lead to different results for different algorithms, especially for special circumstances such as very large inputs, e.g. sin(1022).\nA common programming optimization, used especially in 3D graphics, is to pre-calculate a table of sine values, for example one value per degree, then for values in-between pick the closest pre-calculated value, or linearly interpolate between the 2 closest values to approximate it. This allows results to be looked up from a table rather than being calculated in real time. With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage.The CORDIC algorithm is commonly used in scientific calculators.\nThe sine and cosine functions, along with other trigonometric functions, is widely available across programming languages and platforms. In computing, they are typically abbreviated to sin and cos.\nSome CPU architectures have a built-in instruction for sine, including the Intel x87 FPUs since the 80387.\nIn programming languages, sin and cos are typically either a built-in function or found within the language's standard math library.\nFor example, the C standard library defines sine functions within math.h: sin(double), sinf(float), and sinl(long double). The parameter of each is a floating point value, specifying the angle in radians. Each function returns the same data type as it accepts. Many other trigonometric functions are also defined in math.h, such as for cosine, arc sine, and hyperbolic sine (sinh).\nSimilarly, Python defines math.sin(x) and math.cos(x) within the built-in math module. Complex sine and cosine functions are also available within the cmath module, e.g. cmath.sin(z). CPython's math functions call the C math library, and use a double-precision floating-point format.\n\n\n=== Turns based implementations ===\nSome software libraries provide implementations of sine and cosine using the input angle in half-turns, a half-turn being an angle of 180 degrees or \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi }\n   radians. Representing angles in turns or half-turns has accuracy advantages and efficiency advantages in some cases. In MATLAB, OpenCL, R, Julia, CUDA, and ARM, these function are called sinpi and cospi. For example, sinpi(x) would evaluate to \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03c0\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(\\pi x),}\n   where x is expressed in half-turns, and consequently the final input to the function, \u03c0x can be interpreted in radians by sin.\nThe accuracy advantage stems from the ability to perfectly represent key angles like full-turn, half-turn, and quarter-turn losslessly in binary floating-point or fixed-point. In contrast, representing \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\pi }\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi }\n  , and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {\\pi }{2}}}\n   in binary floating-point or binary scaled fixed-point always involves a loss of accuracy since irrational  numbers cannot be represented with finitely many binary digits.\nTurns also have an accuracy advantage and efficiency advantage for computing modulo to one period. Computing modulo 1 turn or modulo 2 half-turns can be losslessly and efficiently computed in both floating-point and fixed-point. For example, computing modulo 1 or modulo 2 for a binary point scaled fixed-point value requires only a bit shift or bitwise AND operation. In contrast, computing modulo \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {\\pi }{2}}}\n   involves inaccuracies in representing \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {\\pi }{2}}}\n  .\nFor applications involving angle sensors, the sensor typically provides angle measurements in a form directly compatible with turns or half-turns. For example, an angle sensor may count from 0 to 4096 over one complete revolution. If half-turns are used as the unit for angle, then the value provided by the sensor directly and losslessly maps to a fixed-point data type with 11 bits to the right of the binary point. In contrast, if radians are used as the unit for storing the angle, then the inaccuracies and cost of multiplying the raw sensor integer by an approximation to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2048\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {\\pi }{2048}}}\n   would be incurred.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nTraupman, Ph.D., John C.

This line containing the opposite side is called the extended base of the altitude. The intersection of the extended base and the altitude is called the foot of the altitude. The length of the altitude, often simply called \"the altitude\", is the distance between the extended base and the vertex.  The process of drawing the altitude from the vertex to the foot is known as dropping the altitude at that vertex. It is a special case of orthogonal projection.\nAltitudes can be used in the computation of the area of a triangle: one-half of the product of an altitude's length and its base's length equals the triangle's area. Thus, the longest altitude is perpendicular to the shortest side of the triangle. The altitudes are also related to the sides of the triangle through the trigonometric functions.\nIn an isosceles triangle (a triangle with two congruent sides), the altitude having the incongruent side as its base will have the midpoint of that side as its foot. Also the altitude having the incongruent side as its base will be the angle bisector of the vertex angle.\nIt is common to mark the altitude with the letter h (as in height), often subscripted with the name of the side the altitude is drawn to.\n\nIn a right triangle, the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse c divides the hypotenuse into two segments of lengths p and q. If we denote the length of the altitude by hc, we then have the relation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            p\n            q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h_{c}={\\sqrt {pq}}}\n    (Geometric mean theorem)\n\nFor acute triangles, the feet of the altitudes all fall on the triangle's sides (not extended). In an obtuse triangle (one with an obtuse angle), the foot of the altitude to the obtuse-angled vertex falls in the interior of the opposite side, but the feet of the altitudes to the acute-angled vertices fall on the opposite extended side, exterior to the triangle. This is illustrated in the adjacent diagram: in this obtuse triangle, an altitude dropped perpendicularly from the top vertex, which has an acute angle, intersects the extended horizontal side outside the triangle.\n\n\n== Orthocenter ==\n\nThe three (possibly extended) altitudes intersect in a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle, usually denoted by H.  The orthocenter lies inside the triangle if and only if the triangle is acute. If one angle is a right angle, the orthocenter coincides with the vertex at the right angle.Let A, B, C denote the vertices and also the angles of the triangle, and let \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                B\n                C\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        ,\n        b\n        =\n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                C\n                A\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        ,\n        c\n        =\n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                B\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a=\\left|{\\overline {BC}}\\right|,b=\\left|{\\overline {CA}}\\right|,c=\\left|{\\overline {AB}}\\right|}\n   be the side lengths.

barycentric coordinates are all positive for a point in a triangle's interior but at least one is negative for a point in the exterior, and two of the barycentric coordinates are zero for a vertex

triangle.\nIn the complex plane, let the points  A, B, C represent the numbers zA, zB, zC and assume that the circumcenter of triangle \u25b3ABC is located at the origin of the plane.

The sides of the orthic triangle are parallel to the tangents to the circumcircle at the original triangle's vertices.The orthic triangle of an acute triangle gives a triangular light route.The tangent lines of the nine-point circle at the midpoints of the sides of \u25b3ABC are parallel to the sides of the orthic triangle, forming a triangle similar to the orthic triangle.The orthic triangle is closely related to the tangential triangle, constructed as follows:  let LA be the line tangent to the circumcircle of triangle \u25b3ABC at vertex A, and define LB, LC analogously.

It was also mentioned by Pappus (Mathematical Collection, VII, 62; c. 340). The theorem was stated and proved explicitly by al-Nasawi in his (11th century) commentary on the Book of Lemmas, and attributed to al-Quhi (fl.\u200910th century).This proof in Arabic was translated as part of the (early 17th century) Latin editions of the Book of Lemmas, but was not widely known in Europe, and the theorem was therefore proven several more times in the 17th\u201319th century. Samuel Marolois proved it in his Geometrie (1619), and Isaac Newton proved it in an unfinished treatise Geometry of Curved Lines (c. 1680). Later William Chapple proved it in 1749.A particularly elegant proof is due to Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Servois (1804) and independently Carl Friedrich Gauss (1810): Draw a line parallel to each side of the triangle through the opposite point, and form a new triangle from the intersections of these three lines. Then the original triangle is the medial triangle of the new triangle, and the altitudes of the original triangle are the perpendicular bisectors of the new triangle, and therefore concur (at the circumcenter of the new triangle).\n\n\n== See also ==\nTriangle center\nMedian (geometry)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAltshiller-Court, Nathan (2007) [1952], College Geometry, Dover\nBerele, Allan; Goldman, Jerry (2001), Geometry: Theorems and Constructions, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-087121-4\nBogomolny, Alexander. \"Existence of the Orthocenter\".

Specifically, they are the inverses of the sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in engineering, navigation, physics, and geometry.\n\n\n== Notation ==\n\nSeveral notations for the inverse trigonometric functions exist. The most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix: arcsin(x), arccos(x), arctan(x), etc. (This convention is used throughout this article.)  This notation arises from the following geometric relationships:\nwhen measuring in radians, an angle of \u03b8 radians will correspond to an arc whose length is r\u03b8, where r is the radius of the circle. Thus in the unit circle, \"the arc whose cosine is x\" is the same as \"the angle whose cosine is x\", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians. In computer programming languages, the inverse trigonometric functions are often called by the abbreviated forms asin, acos, atan.The notations sin\u22121(x), cos\u22121(x), tan\u22121(x), etc., as introduced by John Herschel in 1813, are often used as well in English-language sources, much more than the also established sin[\u22121](x), cos[\u22121](x), tan[\u22121](x),\u2014conventions consistent with the notation of an inverse function, that is useful e.g. to define the multivalued version of each inverse trigonometric function: e.g. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          tan\n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        {\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        +\n        \u03c0\n        k\n        \u2223\n        k\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan ^{-1}(x)=\\{\\arctan(x)+\\pi k\\mid k\\in \\mathbb {Z} \\}}\n  . However, this might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions such as sin2(x) (although only sin2 x, without parentheses, is the really common one), which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between multiplicative inverse or reciprocal and compositional inverse. The confusion is somewhat mitigated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name\u2014for example, (cos(x))\u22121 = sec(x). Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity. Another precarious convention used by a tiny number of authors is to use an uppercase first letter, along with a \u22121 superscript: Sin\u22121(x), Cos\u22121(x), Tan\u22121(x), etc.  Although its intention is to avoid confusion with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by sin\u22121(x), cos\u22121(x), etc., or, better, by sin\u22121 x, cos\u22121 x, etc., it in turn creates yet another major source of ambiguity: especially in light of the fact that many popular high-level programming languages (e.g. Wolfram's Mathematica, and University of Sydney's MAGMA) use those very same capitalised representations for the standard trig functions; whereas others (Python (ie SymPy and NumPy), Matlab, MAPLE etc) use lower-case. \nHence, since 2009, the ISO 80000-2 standard has specified solely the \"arc\" prefix for the inverse functions.\n\n\n== Basic concepts ==\n\n\n=== Principal values ===\nSince none of the six trigonometric functions are one-to-one, they must be restricted in order to have inverse functions.

second of these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from \u2212i to the point at infinity, going down the imaginary axis, and from i to the point at infinity, going up the same axis. It works best for real numbers running from \u22121 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (nz)2, with each perfect square appearing once. The first was developed by Leonhard Euler; the second by Carl Friedrich Gauss utilizing the Gaussian hypergeometric series.\n\n\n=== Indefinite integrals of inverse trigonometric functions ===\nFor

inverse trigonometric functions are analytic functions, they can be extended from the real line to the complex plane. This results in functions with multiple sheets and branch points. One possible way of defining the extension is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            z\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        z\n        \u2260\n        \u2212\n        i\n        ,\n        +\n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\arctan(z)=\\int _{0}^{z}{\\frac {dx}{1+x^{2}}}\\quad z\\neq -i,+i}\n  where the part of the imaginary axis which does not lie strictly between the branch points (\u2212i and +i) is the branch cut between the principal sheet and other sheets. The path of the integral must not cross a branch cut. For z not on a branch cut, a straight line path from 0 to z is such a path. For z on a branch cut, the path must approach from Re[x] > 0 for the upper branch cut and from Re[x] < 0 for the lower branch cut.\nThe arcsine function may then be defined as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        arcsin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              z\n              \n                1\n                \u2212\n                \n                  z\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n        z\n        \u2260\n        \u2212\n        1\n        ,\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\arcsin(z)=\\arctan \\left({\\frac {z}{\\sqrt {1-z^{2}}}}\\right)\\quad z\\neq -1,+1}\n  where (the square-root function has its cut along the negative real axis and) the part of the real axis which does not lie strictly between \u22121 and +1 is the branch cut between the principal sheet of arcsin and other sheets;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        arccos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        arcsin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        \n        z\n        \u2260\n        \u2212\n        1\n        ,\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\arccos(z)={\\frac {\\pi }{2}}-\\arcsin(z)\\quad z\\neq -1,+1}\n  which has the same cut as arcsin;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        arccot\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        \n        z\n        \u2260\n        \u2212\n        i\n        ,\n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {arccot}(z)={\\frac {\\pi }{2}}-\\arctan(z)\\quad z\\neq -i,i}\n  which has the same cut as arctan;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        arcsec\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        arccos\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              1\n              z\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n        z\n        \u2260\n        \u2212\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {arcsec}(z)=\\arccos \\left({\\frac {1}{z}}\\right)\\quad z\\neq -1,0,+1}\n  where the part of the real axis between \u22121 and +1 inclusive is the cut between the principal sheet of arcsec and other sheets;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        arccsc\n        \u2061\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        arcsin\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              1\n              z\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n        z\n        \u2260\n        \u2212\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {arccsc}(z)=\\arcsin \\left({\\frac {1}{z}}\\right)\\quad z\\neq -1,0,+1}\n  which has the same cut as arcsec.\n\n\n=== Logarithmic forms ===\nThese functions may also be expressed using complex logarithms.

It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.\nIn terms of the standard arctan function, that is with range of (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), it can be expressed as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        atan2\n        \u2061\n        (\n        y\n        ,\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  arctan\n                  \u2061\n                  \n                    (\n                    \n                      \n                        y\n                        x\n                      \n                    \n                    )\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  x\n                  >\n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  arctan\n                  \u2061\n                  \n                    (\n                    \n                      \n                        y\n                        x\n                      \n                    \n                    )\n                  \n                  +\n                  \u03c0\n                \n                \n                  \n                  y\n                  \u2265\n                  0\n                  ,\n                  \n                  x\n                  <\n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  arctan\n                  \u2061\n                  \n                    (\n                    \n                      \n                        y\n                        x\n                      \n                    \n                    )\n                  \n                  \u2212\n                  \u03c0\n                \n                \n                  \n                  y\n                  <\n                  0\n                  ,\n                  \n                  x\n                  <\n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u03c0\n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  y\n                  >\n                  0\n                  ,\n                  \n                  x\n                  =\n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \n                    \n                      \u03c0\n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  y\n                  <\n                  0\n                  ,\n                  \n                  x\n                  =\n                  0\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    undefined\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  y\n                  =\n                  0\n                  ,\n                  \n                  x\n                  =\n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {atan2} (y,x)={\\begin{cases}\\arctan \\left({\\frac {y}{x}}\\right)&\\quad x>0\\\\\\arctan \\left({\\frac {y}{x}}\\right)+\\pi &\\quad y\\geq 0,\\;x<0\\\\\\arctan \\left({\\frac {y}{x}}\\right)-\\pi &\\quad y<0,\\;x<0\\\\{\\frac {\\pi }{2}}&\\quad y>0,\\;x=0\\\\-{\\frac {\\pi }{2}}&\\quad y<0,\\;x=0\\\\{\\text{undefined}}&\\quad y=0,\\;x=0\\end{cases}}}\n  It also equals the principal value of the argument of the complex number x + iy.\nThis limited version of the function above may also be defined using the tangent half-angle formulae as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        atan2\n        \u2061\n        (\n        y\n        ,\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        2\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              y\n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      x\n                      \n                        2\n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    \n                      y\n                      \n                        2\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                +\n                x\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {atan2} (y,x)=2\\arctan \\left({\\frac {y}{{\\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}+x}}\\right)}\n  provided that either x > 0 or y \u2260 0.

Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment\nAn alternative method is to draw a circle with radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  , place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.\nIn both methods a by-product is the formation of vesica piscis.\nThe proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of Euclid's Elements.\n\n\n== Derivation of area formula ==\nThe area formula \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n            \n            4\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{4}}a^{2}}\n   in terms of side length \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   can be derived directly using the Pythagorean theorem or using trigonometry.\n\n\n=== Using the Pythagorean theorem ===\nThe area of a triangle is half of one side \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   times the height \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   from that side:\n\nThe legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  , and the hypotenuse is the side \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   of the equilateral triangle.

tiles two dimensional space with six triangles meeting at a vertex, whose dual tessellation is the hexagonal tiling. 3.122, 3.4.6.4, (3.6)2, 32.4.3.4, and 34.6 are all semi-regular tessellations constructed with equilateral triangles.\n\nIn three dimensions, equilateral triangles form faces of regular and uniform polyhedra. Three of the five Platonic solids are composed of equilateral triangles: the tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron.:\u200ap.238\u200a In particular, the tetrahedron, which has four equilateral triangles for faces, can be considered the three-dimensional analogue of the triangle. All Platonic solids can inscribe tetrahedra, as well as be inscribed inside tetrahedra. Equilateral triangles also form uniform antiprisms as well as uniform star antiprisms in three-dimensional space. For antiprisms, two (non-mirrored) parallel copies of regular polygons are connected by alternating bands of \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2n}\n   equilateral triangles.

The Platonic octahedron is also a triangular antiprism, which is the first true member of the infinite family of antiprisms (the tetrahedron, as a digonal antiprism, is sometimes considered the first).:\u200ap.240\u200aAs a generalization, the equilateral triangle belongs to the infinite family of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  -simplexes, with \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        =\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n=2}\n  .\n\n\n== In culture and society ==\nEquilateral triangles have frequently appeared in man made constructions:\n\nThe shape occurs in modern architecture such as the cross-section of the Gateway Arch.\nIts applications in flags and heraldry includes the flag of Nicaragua and the flag of the Philippines.\nIt is a shape of a variety of road signs, including the yield sign.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlmost-equilateral Heronian triangle\nIsosceles triangle\nTernary plot\nTrilinear coordinates\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Equilateral Triangle\".

It is the smallest regular polygon with this property. This type of construction is called a neusis construction. It is also constructible with compass, straightedge and angle trisector. The impossibility of straightedge and compass construction follows from the observation that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            2\n            cos\n            \u2061\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    2\n                    \u03c0\n                  \n                  7\n                \n              \n            \n            \u2248\n            1.247\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {2\\cos {\\tfrac {2\\pi }{7}}\\approx 1.247}}\n   is a zero of the irreducible cubic x3 + x2 \u2212 2x \u2212 1. Consequently, this polynomial is the minimal polynomial of 2cos(2\u03c0\u20447), whereas the degree of the minimal polynomial for a constructible number must be a power of 2.\n\n\n=== Approximation ===\nAn approximation for practical use with an error of about 0.2% is shown in the drawing.

coincide with one side and two particular diagonals of the regular heptagon.\n\n\n=== In polyhedra ===\nApart from the heptagonal prism and heptagonal antiprism, no convex polyhedron made entirely out of regular polygons contains a heptagon as a face.\n\n\n== Star heptagons ==\nTwo kinds of star heptagons (heptagrams) can be constructed from regular heptagons, labeled by Schl\u00e4fli symbols {7/2}, and {7/3}, with the divisor being the interval of connection.\nBlue, {7/2} and green {7/3} star heptagons inside a red heptagon.\n\n\n== Tiling and packing ==\n\nA regular triangle, heptagon, and 42-gon can completely fill a plane vertex. However, there is no tiling of the plane with only these polygons, because there is no way to fit one of them onto the third side of the triangle without leaving a gap or creating an overlap. In the hyperbolic plane, tilings by regular heptagons are possible.\nThe regular heptagon has a double lattice packing of the Euclidean plane of packing density approximately 0.89269. This has been conjectured to be the lowest density possible for the optimal double lattice packing density of any convex set, and more generally for the optimal packing density of any convex set.\n\n\n== Empirical examples ==\n\nThe United Kingdom, as of 2022, has two heptagonal coins, the 50p and 20p pieces, and the Barbados Dollar are also heptagonal. Strictly, the shape of the coins is a Reuleaux heptagon, a curvilinear heptagon which has curves of constant width; the sides are curved outwards to allow the coins to roll smoothly when they are inserted into a vending machine. Botswana pula coins in the denominations of 2 Pula, 1 Pula, 50 Thebe and 5 Thebe are also shaped as equilateral-curve heptagons. Coins in the shape of Reuleaux heptagons are also in circulation in Mauritius, U.A.E., Tanzania, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Haiti, Jamaica, Liberia, Ghana, the Gambia, Jordan, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Guyana, Solomon Islands, Falkland Islands and Saint Helena. The 1000 Kwacha coin of Zambia is a true heptagon.\nThe Brazilian 25-cent coin has a heptagon inscribed in the coin's disk. Some old versions of the coat of arms of Georgia, including in Soviet days, used a {7/2} heptagram as an element.\nA number of coins, including the 20 euro cent coin, have heptagonal symmetry in a shape called the Spanish flower.\nIn architecture, heptagonal floor plans are very rare. A remarkable example is the Mausoleum of Prince Ernst in Stadthagen, Germany.\nMany police badges in the US have a {7/2} heptagram outline.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHeptagram\nPolygon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDefinition and properties of a heptagon With interactive animation\nHeptagon according Johnson\nAnother approximate construction method\nPolygons \u2013 Heptagons\nRecently discovered and highly accurate approximation for the construction of a regular heptagon.\nHeptagon, an approximating construction as an animation\nA heptagon with a given side, an approximating construction as an animation", "Collinearity": "In geometry, collinearity of a set of points is the property of their lying on a single line. A set of points with this property is said to be collinear (sometimes spelled as colinear). In greater generality, the term has been used for aligned objects, that is, things being \"in a line\" or \"in a row\".\n\n\n== Points on a line ==\nIn any geometry, the set of points on a line are said to be collinear. In Euclidean geometry this relation is intuitively visualized by points lying in a row on a \"straight line\". However, in most geometries (including Euclidean) a line is typically a primitive (undefined) object type, so such visualizations will not necessarily be appropriate. A model for the geometry offers an interpretation of how the points, lines and other object types relate to one another and a notion such as collinearity must be interpreted within the context of that model. For instance, in spherical geometry, where lines are represented in the standard model by great circles of a sphere, sets of collinear points lie on the same great circle. Such points do not lie on a \"straight line\" in the Euclidean sense, and are not thought of as being in a row.\nA mapping of a geometry to itself which sends lines to lines is called a collineation; it preserves the collinearity property. \nThe linear maps (or linear functions) of vector spaces, viewed as geometric maps, map lines to lines; that is, they map collinear point sets to collinear point sets and so, are collineations. In projective geometry these linear mappings are called homographies and are just one type of collineation.\n\n\n== Examples in Euclidean geometry ==\n\n\n=== Triangles ===\nIn any triangle the following sets of points are collinear:\n\nThe orthocenter, the circumcenter, the centroid, the Exeter point, the de Longchamps point, and the center of the nine-point circle are collinear, all falling on a line called the Euler line.\nThe de Longchamps point also has other collinearities.\nAny vertex, the tangency of the opposite side with an excircle, and the Nagel point are collinear in a line called a splitter of the triangle.\nThe midpoint of any side, the point that is equidistant from it along the triangle's boundary in either direction (so these two points bisect the perimeter), and the center of the Spieker circle  are collinear in a line called a cleaver of the triangle. (The Spieker circle is the incircle of the medial triangle, and its center is the center of mass of the perimeter of the triangle.)\nAny vertex, the tangency of the opposite side with the incircle, and the Gergonne point are collinear.\nFrom any point on the circumcircle of a triangle, the nearest points on each of the three extended sides of the triangle are collinear in the Simson line of the point on the circumcircle.\nThe lines connecting the feet of the altitudes intersect the opposite sides at collinear points.:\u200ap.199\u200a\nA triangle's incenter, the midpoint of an altitude, and the point of contact of the corresponding side with the excircle relative to that side are collinear.:\u200ap.120,\u200a#78\u200a\nMenelaus' theorem states that three points \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          P\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          P\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}}\n   on the sides (some  extended) of a triangle opposite vertices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          A\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          A\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}}\n   respectively are collinear if and only if the following products of segment lengths are equal::\u200ap. 147\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          P\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          P\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          P\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          P\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{1}A_{2}\\cdot P_{2}A_{3}\\cdot P_{3}A_{1}=P_{1}A_{3}\\cdot P_{2}A_{1}\\cdot P_{3}A_{2}.}\n  The incenter, the centroid, and the Spieker circle's center are collinear.\nThe circumcenter, the Brocard midpoint, and the Lemoine point of a triangle are collinear.\nTwo perpendicular lines intersecting at the orthocenter of a triangle each intersect each of the triangle's extended sides. The midpoints on the three sides of these points of intersection are collinear in the Droz\u2013Farny line.\n\n\n=== Quadrilaterals ===\nIn a convex quadrilateral ABCD whose opposite sides intersect at E and F, the midpoints of AC, BD, EF are collinear and the line through them is called the Newton line (sometimes known as the Newton-Gauss line). If the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral, then its incenter also lies on this line.\nIn a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter H, the \"area centroid\" G, and the quasicircumcenter O are collinear in this order, and HG = 2GO.  (See Quadrilateral#Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral.)Other collinearities of a tangential quadrilateral are given in Tangential quadrilateral#Collinear points.\nIn a cyclic quadrilateral, the circumcenter, the vertex centroid (the intersection of the two bimedians), and the anticenter are collinear.\nIn a cyclic quadrilateral, the area centroid, the vertex centroid, and the intersection of the diagonals are collinear.\nIn a tangential trapezoid, the tangencies of the incircle with the two bases are collinear with the incenter.\nIn a tangential trapezoid, the midpoints of the legs are collinear with the incenter.\n\n\n=== Hexagons ===\nPascal's theorem (also known as the Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem) states that if an arbitrary six points are chosen on a conic section (i.e., ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) and joined by line segments in any order to form a hexagon, then the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon (extended if necessary) meet in three points which lie on a straight line, called the Pascal line of the hexagon. The converse is also true: the Braikenridge\u2013Maclaurin theorem states that if the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line, then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic, which may be degenerate as in Pappus's hexagon theorem.\n\n\n=== Conic sections ===\nBy Monge's theorem, for any three circles in a plane, none of which is completely inside one of the others, the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines, each externally tangent to two of the circles, are collinear.\nIn an ellipse, the center, the two foci, and the two vertices with the smallest radius of curvature are collinear, and the center and the two vertices with the greatest radius of curvature are collinear.\nIn a hyperbola, the center, the two foci, and the two vertices are collinear.\n\n\n=== Cones ===\nThe center of mass of a conic solid of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex, on the straight line joining the two.\n\n\n=== Tetrahedrons ===\nThe centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter. These points define the Euler line of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the Euler line of a triangle. The center of the tetrahedron's twelve-point sphere also lies on the Euler line.\n\n\n== Algebra ==\n\n\n=== Collinearity of points whose coordinates are given ===\nIn coordinate geometry, in n-dimensional space, a set of three or more distinct points are collinear if and only if, the matrix of the coordinates of these vectors is of rank 1 or less.

Given a set of collinear points, by plane duality we obtain a set of lines all of which meet at a common point. The property that this set of lines has (meeting at a common point) is called concurrency, and the lines are said to be concurrent lines. Thus, concurrency is the plane dual notion to collinearity.\n\n\n== Collinearity graph ==\nGiven a partial geometry P, where two points determine at most one line, a collinearity graph of P is a graph whose vertices are the points of P, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if they determine a line in P.\n\n\n== Usage in statistics and econometrics ==\n\nIn statistics, collinearity refers to a linear relationship between two explanatory variables. Two variables are perfectly collinear if there is an exact linear relationship between the two, so the correlation between them is equal to 1 or \u22121.

In the photography setting, the equations are derived by considering the central projection of a point of the object through the optical centre of the camera to the image in the image (sensor) plane. The three points, object point, image point and optical centre, are always collinear. Another way to say this is that the line segments joining the object points with their image points are all concurrent at the optical centre.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPappus's hexagon theorem\nNo-three-in-line problem\nIncidence (geometry)#Collinearity\nCoplanarity\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrannan, David A.; Esplen, Matthew F.; Gray, Jeremy J.

The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezoid. The other two sides are called the legs (or the lateral sides) if they are not parallel; otherwise, the trapezoid is a parallelogram, and there are two pairs of bases. A scalene trapezoid is a trapezoid with no sides of equal measure, in contrast with the special cases below.\n\n\n== Etymology and trapezium versus trapezoid ==\n\nAncient Greek mathematician Euclid defined five types of quadrilateral, of which four had two sets of parallel sides (known in English as square, rectangle, rhombus and rhomboid) and the last did not have two sets of parallel sides \u2013 a \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03b1 (trapezia literally \"a table\", itself from \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2 (tetr\u00e1s), \"four\" + \u03c0\u03ad\u03b6\u03b1 (p\u00e9za), \"a foot; end, border, edge\").Two types of trapezia were introduced by Proclus (412 to 485 AD) in his commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements:\none pair of parallel sides \u2013 a trapezium (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), divided into isosceles (equal legs) and scalene (unequal) trapezia\nno parallel sides \u2013 trapezoid (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae, trapezoeid\u00e9, literally trapezium-like (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 means \"resembles\"), in the same way as cuboid means cube-like and rhomboid means rhombus-like)All European languages follow Proclus's structure as did English until the late 18th century, until an influential mathematical dictionary published by Charles Hutton in 1795 supported without explanation a transposition of the terms. This mistake was corrected in British English in about 1875, but was retained in American English into the modern day.The following is a table comparing usages, with the most specific definitions at the top to the most general at the bottom.\n\n\n== Inclusive versus exclusive definition ==\nThere is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids. Some define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral having only one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive definition), thereby excluding parallelograms. Others define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as calculus. This article uses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a trapezoid. This is also advocated in the taxonomy of quadrilaterals.\nUnder the inclusive definition, all parallelograms (including rhombuses, squares and non-square rectangles) are trapezoids. Rectangles have mirror symmetry on mid-edges; rhombuses have mirror symmetry on vertices, while squares have mirror symmetry on both mid-edges and vertices.\n\n\n== Special cases ==\n\nA right trapezoid (also called right-angled trapezoid) has two adjacent right angles. Right trapezoids are used in the trapezoidal rule for estimating areas under a curve.\nAn acute trapezoid has two adjacent acute angles on its longer base edge.\nAn obtuse trapezoid on the other hand has one acute and one obtuse angle on each base.\nAn isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the base angles have the same measure. As a consequence the two legs are also of equal length and it has reflection symmetry. This is possible for acute trapezoids or right trapezoids (as rectangles).\nA parallelogram is a trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). It is possible for obtuse trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).\nA tangential trapezoid is a trapezoid that has an incircle.\nA Saccheri quadrilateral is similar to a trapezoid in the hyperbolic plane, with two adjacent right angles, while it is a rectangle in the Euclidean plane. A Lambert quadrilateral in the hyperbolic plane has 3 right angles.\n\n\n== Condition of existence ==\nFour lengths a, c, b, d can constitute the consecutive sides of a non-parallelogram trapezoid with a and b parallel only when\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          d\n          \u2212\n          c\n          \n            |\n          \n          <\n          \n            |\n          \n          b\n          \u2212\n          a\n          \n            |\n          \n          <\n          d\n          +\n          c\n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\displaystyle |d-c|<|b-a|<d+c.}\n  The quadrilateral is a parallelogram when \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        \u2212\n        c\n        =\n        b\n        \u2212\n        a\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d-c=b-a=0}\n  , but it is an ex-tangential quadrilateral (which is not a trapezoid) when \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        d\n        \u2212\n        c\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        b\n        \u2212\n        a\n        \n          |\n        \n        \u2260\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |d-c|=|b-a|\\neq 0}\n  .:\u200ap. 35\u200a\n\n\n== Characterizations ==\n\nGiven a convex quadrilateral, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid:\n\nIt has two adjacent angles that are supplementary, that is, they add up to 180 degrees.\nThe angle between a side and a diagonal is equal to the angle between the opposite side and the same diagonal.\nThe diagonals cut each other in mutually the same ratio (this ratio is the same as that between the lengths of the parallel sides).\nThe diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles of which one opposite pair have equal areas.:\u200aProp.5\u200a\nThe product of the areas of the two triangles formed by one diagonal equals the product of the areas of the two triangles formed by the other diagonal.:\u200aThm.6\u200a\nThe areas S and T of some two opposite triangles of the four triangles formed by the diagonals satisfy the equation\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            T\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {K}}={\\sqrt {S}}+{\\sqrt {T}},}\n  where K is the area of the quadrilateral.:\u200aThm.8\u200aThe midpoints of two opposite sides and the intersection of the diagonals are collinear.:\u200aThm.15\u200a\nThe angles in the quadrilateral ABCD satisfy \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        A\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        C\n        =\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        B\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        D\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin A\\sin C=\\sin B\\sin D.}\n  :\u200ap. 25\u200a\nThe cosines of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cosines of the other two angles.:\u200ap. 25\u200a\nThe cotangents of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cotangents of the other two adjacent angles.:\u200ap. 26\u200a\nOne bimedian divides the quadrilateral into two quadrilaterals of equal areas.:\u200ap. 26\u200a\nTwice the length of the bimedian connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides equals the sum of the lengths of the other sides.:\u200ap. 31\u200aAdditionally, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that opposite sides a and b are parallel:\n\nThe consecutive sides a, c, b, d and the diagonals p, q satisfy the equation:\u200aCor.11\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          q\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          d\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        a\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p^{2}+q^{2}=c^{2}+d^{2}+2ab.}\n  The distance v between the midpoints of the diagonals satisfies the equation:\u200aThm.12\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              a\n              \u2212\n              b\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {|a-b|}{2}}.}\n  \n\n\n== Midsegment and height ==\nThe midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs.

Eric Kalu, Numerical Methods with Applications, (2008)", "Polyhedron": "In geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons; from Greek  \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd (poly-)  'many', and  \u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (-hedron)  'base, seat') is a three-dimensional shape with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices.\nA convex polyhedron is the convex hull of finitely many points, not all on the same plane. Cubes and pyramids are examples of convex polyhedra.\nA polyhedron is a 3-dimensional example of a polytope, a more general concept in any number of dimensions.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nConvex polyhedra are well-defined, with several equivalent standard definitions. However, the formal mathematical definition of polyhedra that are not required to be convex has been problematic.\nMany definitions of \"polyhedron\" have been given within particular contexts, some more rigorous than others, and there is not universal agreement over which of these to choose.\nSome of these definitions exclude shapes that have often been counted as polyhedra (such as the self-crossing polyhedra) or include\nshapes that are often not considered as valid polyhedra (such as solids whose boundaries are not manifolds). As Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum observed,\n\n\"The Original Sin in the theory of polyhedra goes back to Euclid, and through Kepler, Poinsot, Cauchy and many others ... at each stage ... the writers failed to define what are the polyhedra\".\nNevertheless, there is general agreement that a polyhedron is a solid or surface that can be described by its vertices (corner points), edges (line segments connecting certain pairs of vertices),\nfaces (two-dimensional polygons), and that it sometimes can be said to have a particular three-dimensional interior volume.\nOne can distinguish among these different definitions according to whether they describe the polyhedron as a solid, whether they describe it as a surface, or whether they describe it more abstractly based on its incidence geometry.\nA common and somewhat naive definition of a polyhedron is that it is a solid whose boundary can be covered by finitely many planes or that it is a solid formed as the union of finitely many convex polyhedra. Natural refinements of this definition require the solid to be bounded, to have a connected interior, and possibly also to have a connected boundary. The faces of such a polyhedron can be defined as the connected components of the parts of the boundary within each of the planes that cover it, and the edges and vertices as the line segments and points where the faces meet. However, the polyhedra defined in this way do not include the self-crossing star polyhedra, whose faces may not form simple polygons, and some of whose edges may belong to more than two faces.\nDefinitions based on the idea of a bounding surface rather than a solid are also common. For instance, O'Rourke (1993) defines a polyhedron as a union of convex polygons (its faces), arranged in space so that the intersection of any two polygons is a shared vertex or edge or the empty set and so that their union is a manifold. If a planar part of such a surface is not itself a convex polygon, O'Rourke requires it to be subdivided into smaller convex polygons, with flat dihedral angles between them. Somewhat more generally, Gr\u00fcnbaum defines an acoptic polyhedron to be a collection of simple polygons that form an embedded manifold, with each vertex incident to at least three edges and each two faces intersecting only in shared vertices and edges of each. Cromwell's Polyhedra gives a similar definition but without the restriction of at least three edges per vertex. Again, this type of definition does not encompass the self-crossing polyhedra. Similar notions form the basis of topological definitions of polyhedra, as subdivisions of a topological manifold into topological disks (the faces) whose pairwise intersections are required to be points (vertices), topological arcs (edges), or the empty set. However, there exist topological polyhedra (even with all faces triangles) that cannot be realized as acoptic polyhedra.\nOne modern approach is based on the theory of abstract polyhedra. These can be defined as partially ordered sets whose elements are the vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. A vertex or edge element is less than an edge or face element (in this partial order) when the vertex or edge is part of the edge or face. Additionally, one may include a special bottom element of this partial order (representing the empty set) and a top element representing the whole polyhedron. If the sections of the partial order between elements three levels apart (that is, between each face and the bottom element, and between the top element and each vertex) have the same structure as the abstract representation of a polygon, then these partially ordered sets carry exactly the same information as a topological polyhedron. However, these requirements are often relaxed, to instead require only that sections between elements two levels apart have the same structure as the abstract representation of a line segment. (This means that each edge contains two vertices and belongs to two faces, and that each vertex on a face belongs to two edges of that face.) Geometric polyhedra, defined in other ways, can be described abstractly in this way, but it is also possible to use abstract polyhedra as the basis of a definition of geometric polyhedra. A realization of an abstract polyhedron is generally taken to be a mapping from the vertices of the abstract polyhedron to geometric points, such that the points of each face are coplanar. A geometric polyhedron can then be defined as a realization of an abstract polyhedron. Realizations that omit the requirement of face planarity, that impose additional requirements of symmetry, or that map the vertices to higher dimensional spaces have also been considered. Unlike the solid-based and surface-based definitions, this works perfectly well for star polyhedra. However, without additional restrictions, this definition allows degenerate or unfaithful polyhedra (for instance, by mapping all vertices to a single point) and the question of how to constrain realizations to avoid these degeneracies has not been settled.In all of these definitions, a polyhedron is typically understood as a three-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. For example, a polygon has a two-dimensional body and no faces, while a 4-polytope has a four-dimensional body and an additional set of three-dimensional \"cells\".\nHowever, some of the literature on higher-dimensional geometry uses the term \"polyhedron\" to mean something else: not a three-dimensional polytope, but a shape that is different from a polytope in some way. For instance, some sources define a convex polyhedron to be the intersection of finitely many half-spaces, and a polytope to be a bounded polyhedron. The remainder of this article considers only three-dimensional polyhedra.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Number of faces ===\nPolyhedra may be classified and are often named according to the number of faces. The naming system is based on Classical Greek, and combines a prefix counting the faces with the suffix \"hedron\", meaning \"base\" or \"seat\" and referring to the faces. For example a tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four faces, a pentahedron is a polyhedron with five faces, a hexahedron is a polyhedron with six faces, etc. For a complete list of the Greek numeral prefixes see Numeral prefix \u00a7 Table of number prefixes in English, in the column for Greek cardinal numbers. The names of tetrahedra, hexahedra, octahedra (8-sided polyhedra), dodecahedra (12-sided polyhedra), and icosahedra (20-sided polyhedra) are sometimes used without additional qualification to refer to the Platonic solids, and sometimes used to refer more generally to polyhedra with the given number of sides without any assumption of symmetry.\n\n\n=== Topological classification ===\n\nSome polyhedra have two distinct sides to their surface. For example, the inside and outside of a convex polyhedron paper model can each be given a different colour (although the inside colour will be hidden from view). These polyhedra are orientable. The same is true for non-convex polyhedra without self-crossings. Some non-convex self-crossing polyhedra can be coloured in the same way but have regions turned \"inside out\" so that both colours appear on the outside in different places; these are still considered to be orientable. However, for some other self-crossing polyhedra with simple-polygon faces, such as the tetrahemihexahedron, it is not possible to colour the two sides of each face with two different colours so that adjacent faces have consistent colours.\nIn this case the polyhedron is said to be non-orientable. For polyhedra with self-crossing faces, it may not be clear what it means for adjacent faces to be consistently coloured, but for these polyhedra it is still possible to determine whether it is orientable or non-orientable by considering a topological cell complex with the same incidences between its vertices, edges, and faces.A more subtle distinction between polyhedron surfaces is given by their Euler characteristic, which combines the numbers of vertices \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  , edges \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  , and faces \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n   of a polyhedron into a single number \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c7\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\chi }\n   defined by the formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c7\n        =\n        V\n        \u2212\n        E\n        +\n        F\n        .\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\chi =V-E+F.\\ }\n  The same formula is also used for the Euler characteristic of other kinds of topological surfaces. It is an invariant of the surface, meaning that when a single surface is subdivided into vertices, edges, and faces in more than one way, the Euler characteristic will be the same for these subdivisions. For a convex polyhedron, or more generally any simply connected polyhedron with surface a topological sphere, it always equals 2.  For more complicated shapes, the Euler characteristic relates to the number of toroidal holes, handles or cross-caps in the surface and will be less than 2. \nAll polyhedra with odd-numbered Euler characteristic are non-orientable. A given figure with even Euler characteristic may or may not be orientable. For example, the one-holed toroid and the Klein bottle both have \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c7\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\chi =0}\n  , with the first being orientable and the other not.For many (but not all) ways of defining polyhedra, the surface of the polyhedron is required to be a manifold. This means that every edge is part of the boundary of exactly two faces (disallowing shapes like the union of two cubes that meet only along a shared edge) and that every vertex is incident to a single alternating cycle of edges and faces (disallowing shapes like the union of two cubes sharing only a single vertex). For polyhedra defined in these ways, the classification of manifolds implies that the topological type of the surface is completely determined by the combination of its Euler characteristic and orientability. For example, every polyhedron whose surface is an orientable manifold and whose Euler characteristic is 2 must be a topological sphere.A toroidal polyhedron is a polyhedron whose Euler characteristic is less than or equal to 0, or equivalently whose genus is 1 or greater.  Topologically, the surfaces of such polyhedra are torus surfaces having one or more holes through the middle.\n\n\n=== Duality ===\n\nFor every convex polyhedron, there exists a dual polyhedron having\n\nfaces in place of the original's vertices and vice versa, and\nthe same number of edges.The dual of a convex polyhedron can be obtained by the process of polar reciprocation.  Dual polyhedra exist in pairs, and the dual of a dual is just the original polyhedron again. Some polyhedra are self-dual, meaning that the dual of the polyhedron is congruent to the original polyhedron.Abstract polyhedra also have duals, obtained by reversing the partial order defining the polyhedron to obtain its dual or opposite order. These have the same Euler characteristic and orientability as the initial polyhedron. However, this form of duality does not describe the shape of a dual polyhedron, but only its combinatorial structure. For some definitions of non-convex geometric polyhedra, there exist polyhedra whose abstract duals cannot be realized as geometric polyhedra under the same definition.\n\n\n=== Vertex figures ===\n\nFor every vertex one can define a vertex figure, which describes the local structure of the polyhedron around the vertex. Precise definitions vary, but a vertex figure can be thought of as the polygon exposed where a slice through the polyhedron cuts off a corner.\n\n\n=== Surface area and distances ===\nThe surface area of a polyhedron is the sum of areas of its faces, for definitions of polyhedra for which the area of a face is well-defined.\nThe geodesic distance between any two points on the surface of a polyhedron measures the length of the shortest curve that connects the two points, remaining within the surface. By Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem, every convex polyhedron is uniquely determined by the metric space of geodesic distances on its surface. However, non-convex polyhedra can have the same surface distances as each other, or the same as certain convex polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Volume ===\nPolyhedral solids have an associated quantity called volume that measures how much space they occupy.  Simple families of solids may have simple formulas for their volumes; for example, the volumes of pyramids, prisms, and parallelepipeds can easily be expressed in terms of their edge lengths or other coordinates.  (See Volume \u00a7 Volume formulas for a list that includes many of these formulas.)\nVolumes of more complicated polyhedra may not have simple formulas.  Volumes of such polyhedra may be computed by subdividing the polyhedron into smaller pieces (for example, by triangulation).  For example, the volume of a regular polyhedron can be computed by dividing it into congruent pyramids, with each pyramid having a face of the polyhedron as its base and the centre of the polyhedron as its apex.\nIn general, it can be derived from the divergence theorem that the volume of a polyhedral solid is given by\n\nwhere the sum is over faces F of the polyhedron, QF is an arbitrary point on face F, NF is the unit vector perpendicular to F pointing outside the solid, and the multiplication dot is the dot product. In higher dimensions, volume computation may be challenging, in part because of the difficulty of listing the faces of a convex polyhedron specified only by its vertices, and there exist specialized algorithms to determine the volume in these cases.\n\n\n=== Dehn invariant ===\n\nIn two dimensions, the Bolyai\u2013Gerwien theorem asserts that any polygon may be transformed into any other polygon of the same area by cutting it up into finitely many polygonal pieces and rearranging them.  The analogous question for polyhedra was the subject of Hilbert's third problem. Max Dehn solved this problem by showing that, unlike in the 2-D case, there exist polyhedra of the same volume that cannot be cut into smaller polyhedra and reassembled into each other. To prove this Dehn discovered another value associated with a polyhedron, the Dehn invariant, such that two polyhedra can only be dissected into each other when they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. It was later proven by Sydler that this is the only obstacle to dissection: every two Euclidean polyhedra with the same volumes and Dehn invariants can be cut up and reassembled into each other. The Dehn invariant is not a number, but a vector in an infinite-dimensional vector space, determined from the lengths and dihedral angles of a polyhedron's edges.Another of Hilbert's problems, Hilbert's 18th problem, concerns (among other things) polyhedra that tile space. Every such polyhedron must have Dehn invariant zero. The Dehn invariant has also been connected to flexible polyhedra by the strong bellows theorem, which states that the Dehn invariant of any flexible polyhedron remains invariant as it flexes.\n\n\n== Convex polyhedra ==\n\nA three-dimensional solid is a convex set if it contains every line segment connecting two of its points. A convex polyhedron is a polyhedron that, as a solid, forms a convex set. A convex polyhedron can also be defined as a bounded intersection of finitely many half-spaces, or as the convex hull of finitely many points.\nImportant classes of convex polyhedra include the highly symmetrical Platonic solids, the Archimedean solids and their duals the Catalan solids, and the regular-faced Johnson solids.\n\n\n== Symmetries ==\n\nMany of the most studied polyhedra are highly symmetrical, that is, their appearance is unchanged by some reflection or rotation of space.  Each such symmetry may change the location of a given vertex, face, or edge, but the set of all vertices (likewise faces, edges) is unchanged.  The collection of symmetries of a polyhedron is called its symmetry group.\nAll the elements that can be superimposed on each other by symmetries are said to form a symmetry orbit. For example, all the faces of a cube lie in one orbit, while all the edges lie in another. If all the elements of a given dimension, say all the faces, lie in the same orbit, the figure is said to be transitive on that orbit. For example, a cube is face-transitive, while a truncated cube has two symmetry orbits of faces.\nThe same abstract structure may support more or less symmetric geometric polyhedra. But where a polyhedral name is given, such as icosidodecahedron, the most symmetrical geometry is almost always implied, unless otherwise stated.There are several types of highly symmetric polyhedron, classified by which kind of element \u2013 faces, edges, or vertices \u2013 belong to a single symmetry orbit:\n\nRegular: vertex-transitive, edge-transitive and face-transitive.  (This implies that every face is the same regular polygon; it also implies that every vertex is regular.)\nQuasi-regular: vertex-transitive and edge-transitive (and hence has regular faces) but not face-transitive. A quasi-regular dual is face-transitive and edge-transitive (and hence every vertex is regular) but not vertex-transitive.\nSemi-regular: vertex-transitive but not edge-transitive, and every face is a regular polygon. (This is one of several definitions of the term, depending on author. Some definitions overlap with the quasi-regular class.) These polyhedra include the semiregular prisms and antiprisms. A semi-regular dual is face-transitive but not vertex-transitive, and every vertex is regular.\nUniform: vertex-transitive and every face is a regular polygon, i.e., it is regular, quasi-regular or semi-regular. A uniform dual is face-transitive and has regular vertices, but is not necessarily vertex-transitive.\nIsogonal: vertex-transitive.\nIsotoxal: edge-transitive.\nIsohedral: face-transitive.\nNoble: face-transitive and vertex-transitive (but not necessarily edge-transitive). The regular polyhedra are also noble; they are the only noble uniform polyhedra.  The duals of noble polyhedra are themselves noble.Some classes of polyhedra have only a single main axis of symmetry. These include the pyramids, bipyramids, trapezohedra, cupolae, as well as the semiregular prisms and antiprisms.\n\n\n=== Regular polyhedra ===\n\nRegular polyhedra are the most highly symmetrical. Altogether there are nine regular polyhedra: five convex and four star polyhedra.\nThe five convex examples have been known since antiquity and are called the Platonic solids. These are the triangular pyramid or tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron:\n\nThere are also four regular star polyhedra, known as the Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra after their discoverers.\nThe dual of a regular polyhedron is also regular.\n\n\n=== Uniform polyhedra and their duals ===\n\nUniform polyhedra are vertex-transitive and every face is a regular polygon.\nThey may be subdivided into the regular, quasi-regular, or semi-regular, and may be convex or starry.\nThe duals of the uniform polyhedra have irregular faces but are face-transitive, and every vertex figure is a regular polygon. A uniform polyhedron has the same symmetry orbits as its dual, with the faces and vertices simply swapped over. The duals of the convex Archimedean polyhedra are sometimes called the Catalan solids.\nThe uniform polyhedra and their duals are traditionally classified according to their degree of symmetry, and whether they are convex or not.\n\n\n=== Isohedra ===\n\nAn isohedron is a polyhedron with symmetries acting transitively on its faces. Their topology can be represented by a face configuration. All 5 Platonic solids and 13 Catalan solids are isohedra, as well as the infinite families of trapezohedra and bipyramids. Some isohedra allow geometric variations including concave and self-intersecting forms.\n\n\n=== Symmetry groups ===\n\nMany of the symmetries or point groups in three dimensions are named after polyhedra having the associated symmetry. These include:\n\nT \u2013 chiral tetrahedral symmetry; the rotation group for a regular tetrahedron; order 12.\nTd \u2013 full tetrahedral symmetry; the symmetry group for a regular tetrahedron; order 24.\nTh \u2013 pyritohedral symmetry; the symmetry of a pyritohedron; order 24.\nO \u2013 chiral octahedral symmetry;the rotation group of the cube and octahedron; order 24.\nOh \u2013 full octahedral symmetry; the symmetry group of the cube and octahedron; order 48.\nI \u2013 chiral icosahedral symmetry; the rotation group of the icosahedron and the dodecahedron; order 60.\nIh \u2013 full icosahedral symmetry; the symmetry group of the icosahedron and the dodecahedron; order 120.\nCnv \u2013 n-fold pyramidal symmetry\nDnh \u2013 n-fold prismatic symmetry\nDnv \u2013 n-fold antiprismatic symmetry.Those with chiral symmetry do not have reflection symmetry and hence have two enantiomorphous forms which are reflections of each other. Examples include the snub cuboctahedron and snub icosidodecahedron.\n\n\n== Other important families of polyhedra ==\n\n\n=== Polyhedra with regular faces ===\nBesides the regular and uniform polyhedra, there are some other classes which have regular faces but lower overall symmetry.\n\n\n==== Equal regular faces ====\nConvex polyhedra where every face is the same kind of regular polygon may be found among three families:\n\nTriangles: These polyhedra are called deltahedra. There are eight convex deltahedra: three of the Platonic solids and five non-uniform examples.\nSquares: The cube is the only convex example. Other examples (the polycubes) can be obtained by joining cubes together, although care must be taken if coplanar faces are to be avoided.\nPentagons: The regular dodecahedron is the only convex example.Polyhedra with congruent regular faces of six or more sides are all non-convex.\nThe total number of convex polyhedra with equal regular faces is thus ten: the five Platonic solids and the five non-uniform deltahedra.  There are infinitely many non-convex examples. Infinite sponge-like examples called infinite skew polyhedra exist in some of these families.\n\n\n==== Johnson solids ====\n\nNorman Johnson sought which convex non-uniform polyhedra had regular faces, although not necessarily all alike.  In 1966, he published a list of 92 such solids, gave them names and numbers, and conjectured that there were no others. Victor Zalgaller proved in 1969 that the list of these Johnson solids was complete.\n\n\n=== Pyramids ===\n\nPyramids include some of the most time-honoured and famous of all polyhedra, such as the four-sided Egyptian pyramids.\n\n\n=== Stellations and facettings ===\n\nStellation of a polyhedron is the process of extending the faces (within their planes) so that they meet to form a new polyhedron.\nFaceting is the process of removing parts of a polyhedron to create new faces, or facets, without creating any new vertices. A facet of a polyhedron is any polygon whose corners are vertices of the polyhedron, and is not a face.Stellation and faceting are inverse or reciprocal processes: the dual of some stellation is a faceting of the dual to the original polyhedron.\n\n\n=== Zonohedra ===\n\nA zonohedron is a convex polyhedron in which every face is a polygon that is symmetric under rotations through 180\u00b0. Zonohedra can also be characterized as the Minkowski sums of line segments, and include several important space-filling polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Space-filling polyhedra ===\n\nA space-filling polyhedron packs with copies of itself to fill space. Such a close-packing or space-filling is often called a tessellation of space or a honeycomb. Space-filling polyhedra must have a Dehn invariant equal to zero. Some honeycombs involve more than one kind of polyhedron.\n\n\n=== Lattice polyhedra ===\n\nA convex polyhedron in which all vertices have integer coordinates is called a lattice polyhedron or integral polyhedron.  The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polyhedron counts how many points with integer coordinates lie within a scaled copy of the polyhedron, as a function of the scale factor. The study of these polynomials lies at the intersection of combinatorics and commutative algebra. There is a far-reaching equivalence between lattice polyhedra and certain algebraic varieties called toric varieties. This was used by Stanley to prove the Dehn\u2013Sommerville equations for simplicial polytopes.\n\n\n=== Flexible polyhedra ===\n\nIt is possible for some polyhedra to change their overall shape, while keeping the shapes of their faces the same, by varying the angles of their edges. A polyhedron that can do this is called a flexible polyhedron. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, flexible polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as the bellows theorem.\n\n\n=== Compounds ===\n\nA polyhedral compound is made of two or more polyhedra sharing a common centre.  Symmetrical compounds often share the same vertices as other well-known polyhedra and may often also be formed by stellation. Some are listed in the list of Wenninger polyhedron models.\n\n\n=== Orthogonal polyhedra ===\n\nAn orthogonal polyhedron is one all of whose faces meet at right angles, and all of whose edges are parallel to axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. (Jessen's icosahedron provides an example of a polyhedron meeting one but not both of these two conditions.) Aside from the rectangular cuboids, orthogonal polyhedra are nonconvex. They are the 3D analogs of 2D orthogonal polygons, also known as rectilinear polygons.  Orthogonal polyhedra are used in computational geometry, where their constrained structure has enabled advances on problems unsolved for arbitrary polyhedra, for example, unfolding the surface of a polyhedron to a polygonal net.Polycubes are a special case of orthogonal polyhedra that can be decomposed into identical cubes, and are three-dimensional analogues of planar polyominoes.\n\n\n=== Embedded regular maps with planar faces ===\nRegular maps are flag transitive abstract 2-manifolds and they have been studied already in the nineteenth century. \nSome of them have 3-dimensional polyhedral embeddings like the one that represents Klein's quartic.\n\n\n=== Canonical polyhedra ===\nEvery convex polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to an essentially unique canonical polyhedron, a polyhedron which has a midsphere tangent to each of its edges.\n\n\n== Generalisations of polyhedra ==\nThe name 'polyhedron' has come to be used for a variety of objects having similar structural properties to traditional polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Apeirohedra ===\nA classical polyhedral surface has a finite number of faces, joined in pairs along edges. The apeirohedra form a related class of objects with infinitely many faces. Examples of apeirohedra include:\n\ntilings or tessellations of the plane, and\nsponge-like structures called infinite skew polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Complex polyhedra ===\n\nThere are objects called complex polyhedra, for which the underlying space is a complex Hilbert space rather than real Euclidean space.  Precise definitions exist only for the regular complex polyhedra, whose symmetry groups are complex reflection groups.  The complex polyhedra are mathematically more closely related to configurations than to real polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Curved polyhedra ===\nSome fields of study allow polyhedra to have curved faces and edges. Curved faces can allow digonal faces to exist with a positive area.\n\n\n==== Spherical polyhedra ====\n\nWhen the surface of a sphere is divided by finitely many great arcs (equivalently, by planes passing through the center of the sphere), the result is called a spherical polyhedron.  Many convex polytopes having some degree of symmetry (for example, all the Platonic solids) can be projected onto the surface of a concentric sphere to produce a spherical polyhedron.  However, the reverse process is not always possible; some spherical polyhedra (such as the hosohedra) have no flat-faced analogue.\n\n\n==== Curved spacefilling polyhedra ====\nIf faces are allowed to be concave as well as convex, adjacent faces may be made to meet together with no gap. Some of these curved polyhedra can pack together to fill space. Two important types are:\n\nBubbles in froths and foams, such as Weaire-Phelan bubbles.\nForms used in architecture.\n\n\n=== Ideal polyhedra ===\n\nConvex polyhedra can be defined in three-dimensional hyperbolic space in the same way as in Euclidean space, as the convex hulls of finite sets of points.\nHowever, in hyperbolic space, it is also possible to consider ideal points as well as the points that lie within the space. An ideal polyhedron is the convex hull of a finite set of ideal points. Its faces are ideal polygons, but its edges are defined by entire hyperbolic lines rather than line segments, and its vertices (the ideal points of which it is the convex hull) do not lie within the hyperbolic space.\n\n\n=== Skeletons and polyhedra as graphs ===\nBy forgetting the face structure, any polyhedron gives rise to a graph, called its skeleton, with corresponding vertices and edges.  Such figures have a long history: Leonardo da Vinci devised frame models of the regular solids, which he drew for Pacioli's book Divina Proportione, and similar wire-frame polyhedra appear in M.C. Escher's print Stars.  One highlight of this approach is Steinitz's theorem, which gives a purely graph-theoretic characterization of the skeletons of convex polyhedra: it states that the skeleton of every convex polyhedron is a 3-connected planar graph, and every 3-connected planar graph is the skeleton of some convex polyhedron.\nAn early idea of abstract polyhedra was developed in Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum's study of \"hollow-faced polyhedra.\"  Gr\u00fcnbaum defined faces to be cyclically ordered sets of vertices, and allowed them to be skew as well as planar.The graph perspective allows one to apply graph terminology and properties to polyhedra.  For example, the tetrahedron and Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r polyhedron are the only known polyhedra whose skeletons are complete graphs (K4), and various symmetry restrictions on polyhedra give rise to skeletons that are symmetric graphs.\n\n\n== Alternative usages ==\nFrom the latter half of the twentieth century, various mathematical constructs have been found to have properties also present in traditional polyhedra. Rather than confining the term \"polyhedron\" to describe a three-dimensional polytope, it has been adopted to describe various related but distinct kinds of structure.\n\n\n=== Higher-dimensional polyhedra ===\nA polyhedron has been defined as a set of points in real affine (or Euclidean) space of any dimension n that has flat sides.  It may alternatively be defined as the intersection of finitely many half-spaces.  Unlike a conventional polyhedron, it may be bounded or unbounded.  In this meaning, a polytope is a bounded polyhedron.Analytically, such a convex polyhedron is expressed as the solution set for a system of linear inequalities. Defining polyhedra in this way provides a geometric perspective for problems in linear programming.\nMany traditional polyhedral forms are polyhedra in this sense. Other examples include:\n\nA quadrant in the plane.  For instance, the region of the cartesian plane consisting of all points above the horizontal axis and to the right of the vertical axis:  { ( x, y ) : x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0 } .  Its sides are the two positive axes, and it is otherwise unbounded.\nAn octant in Euclidean 3-space,   { ( x, y, z ) : x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0, z \u2265 0 } .\nA prism of infinite extent.  For instance a doubly infinite square prism in 3-space, consisting of a square in the xy-plane swept along the z-axis:  { ( x, y, z ) : 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1,  0 \u2264 y \u2264 1 } .\nEach cell in a Voronoi tessellation is a convex polyhedron.  In the Voronoi tessellation of a set S, the cell A corresponding to a point c \u2208 S is bounded (hence a traditional polyhedron) when c lies in the interior of the convex hull of S, and otherwise (when c lies on the boundary of the convex hull of S) A is unbounded.\n\n\n=== Topological polyhedra ===\nA topological polytope is a topological space given along with a specific decomposition into shapes that are topologically equivalent to convex polytopes and that are attached to each other in a regular way.\nSuch a figure is called simplicial if each of its regions is a simplex, i.e. in an n-dimensional space each region has n+1 vertices.  The dual of a simplicial polytope is called simple.  Similarly, a widely studied class of polytopes (polyhedra) is that of cubical polyhedra, when the basic building block is an n-dimensional cube.\n\n\n=== Abstract polyhedra ===\n\nAn abstract polytope is a partially ordered set (poset) of elements whose partial ordering obeys certain rules of incidence (connectivity) and ranking. The elements of the set correspond to the vertices, edges, faces and so on of the polytope: vertices have rank 0, edges rank 1, etc. with the partially ordered ranking corresponding to the dimensionality of the geometric elements. The empty set, required by set theory, has a rank of \u22121 and is sometimes said to correspond to the null polytope. An abstract polyhedron is an abstract polytope having the following ranking:\n\nrank 3: The maximal element, sometimes identified with the body.\nrank 2: The polygonal faces.\nrank 1: The edges.\nrank 0: the vertices.\nrank \u22121: The empty set, sometimes identified with the null polytope or nullitope.Any geometric polyhedron is then said to be a \"realization\" in real space of the abstract poset as described above.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nPrehistoryPolyhedra appeared in early architectural forms such as cubes and cuboids, with the earliest four-sided pyramids of ancient Egypt also dating from the Stone Age.\nThe Etruscans preceded the Greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery of an Etruscan  dodecahedron made of soapstone on Monte Loffa. Its faces were marked with different designs, suggesting to some scholars that it may have been used as a gaming die.\nGreek civilisationThe earliest known written records of these shapes come from Classical Greek authors, who also gave the first known mathematical description of them. The earlier Greeks were interested primarily in the convex regular polyhedra, which came to be known as the Platonic solids. Pythagoras knew at least three of them, and Theaetetus (circa 417 B. C.) described all five. Eventually, Euclid described their construction in his Elements. Later, Archimedes expanded his study to the convex uniform polyhedra which now bear his name. His original work is lost and his solids come down to us through Pappus.\n\nChinaCubical gaming dice in China have been dated back as early as 600 B.C.By 236 AD, Liu Hui was describing the dissection of the cube into its characteristic tetrahedron (orthoscheme) and related solids, using assemblages of these solids as the basis for calculating volumes of earth to be moved during engineering excavations.\n\nIslamic civilisationAfter the end of the Classical era, scholars in the Islamic civilisation continued to take the Greek knowledge forward (see Mathematics in medieval Islam).\nThe 9th century scholar Thabit ibn Qurra gave formulae for calculating the volumes of polyhedra such as truncated pyramids.\nThen in the 10th century Abu'l Wafa described the convex regular and quasiregular spherical polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nAs with other areas of Greek thought maintained and enhanced by Islamic scholars, Western interest in polyhedra revived during the Italian Renaissance. Artists constructed skeletal polyhedra, depicting them from life as a part of their investigations into perspective. Several appear in marquetry panels of the period. Piero della Francesca gave the first written description of direct geometrical construction of such perspective views of polyhedra. Leonardo da Vinci made skeletal models of several polyhedra and drew illustrations of them for a book by Pacioli. A painting by an anonymous artist of Pacioli and a pupil depicts a glass rhombicuboctahedron half-filled with water.\nAs the Renaissance spread beyond Italy, later artists such as Wenzel Jamnitzer, D\u00fcrer and others also depicted polyhedra of various kinds, many of them novel, in imaginative etchings.\n\n\n=== Star polyhedra ===\nFor almost 2,000 years, the concept of a polyhedron as a convex solid had remained as developed by the ancient Greek mathematicians.\nDuring the Renaissance star forms were discovered. A marble tarsia in the floor of St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, depicts a stellated dodecahedron. Artists such as Wenzel Jamnitzer delighted in depicting novel star-like forms of increasing complexity.\nJohannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) used star polygons, typically pentagrams, to build star polyhedra. Some of these figures may have been discovered before Kepler's time, but he was the first to recognize that they could be considered \"regular\" if one removed the restriction that regular polyhedra must be convex. Later, Louis Poinsot realised that star vertex figures (circuits around each corner) can also be used, and discovered the remaining two regular star polyhedra. Cauchy proved Poinsot's list complete, and Cayley gave them their accepted English names: (Kepler's) the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron, and (Poinsot's) the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron. Collectively they are called the Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra.\nThe Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra may be constructed from the Platonic solids by a process called stellation. Most stellations are not regular. The study of stellations of the Platonic solids was given a big push by H.S.M. Coxeter and others in 1938, with the now famous paper The 59 icosahedra.The reciprocal process to stellation is called facetting (or faceting). Every stellation of one polytope is dual, or reciprocal, to some facetting of the dual polytope. The regular star polyhedra can also be obtained by facetting the Platonic solids. Bridge (1974) listed the simpler facettings of the dodecahedron, and reciprocated them to discover a stellation of the icosahedron that was missing from the set of \"59\". More have been discovered since, and the story is not yet ended.\n\n\n=== Euler's formula and topology ===\nTwo other modern mathematical developments had a profound effect on polyhedron theory.\nIn 1750 Leonhard Euler for the first time considered the edges of a polyhedron, allowing him to discover his polyhedron formula relating the number of vertices, edges and faces. This signalled the birth of topology, sometimes referred to as \"rubber sheet geometry\", and Henri Poincar\u00e9 developed its core ideas around the end of the nineteenth century. This allowed many longstanding issues over what was or was not a polyhedron to be resolved.\nMax Br\u00fcckner summarised work on polyhedra to date, including many findings of his own, in his book \"Vielecke und Vielflache: Theorie und Geschichte\" (Polygons and polyhedra: Theory and History). Published in German in 1900, it remained little known.\nMeanwhile, the discovery of higher dimensions led to the idea of a polyhedron as a three-dimensional example of the more general polytope.\n\n\n=== Twentieth-century revival ===\nBy the early years of the twentieth century, mathematicians had moved on and geometry was little studied. Coxeter's analysis in The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra introduced modern ideas from graph theory and combinatorics into the study of polyhedra, signalling a rebirth of interest in geometry.\nCoxeter himself went on to enumerate the star uniform polyhedra for the first time, to treat tilings of the plane as polyhedra, to discover the regular skew polyhedra and to develop the theory of complex polyhedra first discovered by Shephard in 1952, as well as making fundamental contributions to many other areas of geometry.\nIn the second part of the twentieth century, Gr\u00fcnbaum published important works in two areas. One was in convex polytopes, where he noted a tendency among mathematicians to define a \"polyhedron\" in different and sometimes incompatible ways to suit the needs of the moment. The other was a series of papers broadening the accepted definition of a polyhedron, for example discovering many new regular polyhedra. At the close of the 20th century these latter ideas merged with other work on incidence complexes to create the modern idea of an abstract polyhedron (as an abstract 3-polytope), notably presented by McMullen and Schulte.\n\n\n== In nature ==\nFor natural occurrences of regular polyhedra, see Regular polyhedron \u00a7 Regular polyhedra in nature.\nIrregular polyhedra appear in nature as crystals.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== General theory ===\nWeisstein, Eric W., \"Polyhedron\", MathWorld\nPolyhedra Pages\nUniform Solution for Uniform Polyhedra by Dr. Zvi Har'El Archived 2015-11-27 at the Wayback Machine\nSymmetry, Crystals and Polyhedra\n\n\n=== Lists and databases of polyhedra ===\nVirtual Reality Polyhedra \u2013 The Encyclopedia of Polyhedra.\nElectronic Geometry Models \u2013 Contains a peer reviewed selection of polyhedra with unusual properties.\nPolyhedron Models \u2013 Virtual polyhedra.\nPaper Models of Uniform (and other) Polyhedra\nPolyhedra Viewer \u2013 Web-based tool for visualizing the relationships between the convex, regular-faced polyhedra.\n\n\n=== Free software ===\nA Plethora of Polyhedra \u2013 An interactive and free collection of polyhedra in Java.

Cutting an object into slices creates many parallel cross-sections. The boundary of a cross-section in three-dimensional space that is parallel to two of the axes, that is, parallel to the plane determined by these axes, is sometimes referred to as a contour line; for example, if a plane cuts through mountains of a raised-relief map parallel to the ground, the result is a contour line in two-dimensional space showing points on the surface of the mountains of equal elevation.\n\nIn technical drawing a cross-section, being a projection of an object onto a plane that intersects it, is a common tool used to depict the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions.  It is traditionally crosshatched with the style of crosshatching often indicating the types of materials being used.\nWith computed axial tomography, computers can construct cross-sections from x-ray data.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nIf a plane intersects a solid (a 3-dimensional object), then the region common to the plane and the solid is called a cross-section of the solid. A plane containing a cross-section of the solid may be referred to as a cutting plane.\nThe shape of the cross-section of a solid may depend upon the orientation of the cutting plane to the solid. For instance, while all the cross-sections of a ball are disks, the cross-sections of a cube depend on how the cutting plane is related to the cube. If the cutting plane is perpendicular to a line joining the centers of two opposite faces of the cube, the cross-section will be a square, however, if the cutting plane is perpendicular to a diagonal of the cube joining opposite vertices, the cross-section can be either a point, a triangle or a hexagon.\n\n\n=== Plane sections ===\nA related concept is that of a plane section, which is the curve of intersection of a plane with a surface. Thus, a plane section is the boundary of a cross-section of a solid in a cutting plane. \nIf a surface in a three-dimensional space is defined by a function of two variables, i.e., z = f(x, y), the plane sections by cutting planes that are parallel to a coordinate plane (a plane determined by two coordinate axes) are called level curves or isolines.\nMore specifically, cutting planes with equations of the form z = k (planes parallel to the xy-plane) produce plane sections that are often called contour lines in application areas.\n\n\n== Mathematical examples of cross sections and plane sections ==\n\nA cross section of a polyhedron is a polygon.\nThe conic sections \u2013 circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas \u2013 are plane sections of a cone with the cutting planes at various different angles, as seen in the diagram at left.\nAny cross-section passing through the center of an ellipsoid forms an elliptic region, while the corresponding plane sections are ellipses on its surface. These degenerate to disks and circles, respectively, when the cutting planes are perpendicular to a symmetry axis. In more generality, the plane sections of a quadric are conic sections.\n\nA cross-section of a solid right circular cylinder extending between two bases is a disk if the cross-section is parallel to the cylinder's base, or an elliptic region (see diagram at right) if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the base. If the cutting plane is perpendicular to the base it consists of a rectangle (not shown) unless it is just tangent to the cylinder, in which case it is a single line segment.\nThe term cylinder can also mean the lateral surface of a solid cylinder (see cylinder (geometry)). If a cylinder is used in this sense, the above paragraph would read as follows: A plane section of a right circular cylinder of finite length is a circle if the cutting plane is perpendicular to the cylinder's axis of symmetry, or an ellipse if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to that axis. If the cutting plane is parallel to the axis the plane section consists of a pair of parallel line segments unless the cutting plane is tangent to the cylinder, in which case, the plane section is a single line segment.\n\nA plane section can be used to visualize the partial derivative of a function with respect to one of its arguments, as shown. Suppose z = f(x, y). In taking the partial derivative of f(x, y) with respect to x, one can take a plane section of the function f at a fixed value of y to plot the level curve of z solely against x; then the partial derivative with respect to x is the slope of the resulting two-dimensional graph.\n\n\n=== In related subjects ===\nA plane section of a probability density function of two random variables in which the cutting plane is at a fixed value of one of the variables is a conditional density function of the other variable (conditional on the fixed value defining the plane section). If instead the plane section is taken for a fixed value of the density, the result is an iso-density contour. For the normal distribution, these contours are ellipses.\nIn economics, a production function f(x, y) specifies the output that can be produced by various quantities x and y of inputs, typically labor and physical capital. The production function of a firm or a society can be plotted in three-dimensional space. If a plane section is taken parallel to the xy-plane, the result is an isoquant showing the various combinations of labor and capital usage that would result in the level of output given by the height of the plane section. Alternatively, if a plane section of the production function is taken at a fixed level of y\u2014that is, parallel to the xz-plane\u2014then the result is a two-dimensional graph showing how much output can be produced at each of various values of usage x of one input combined with the fixed value of the other input y.\nAlso in economics, a cardinal or ordinal utility function u(w, v) gives the degree of satisfaction of a consumer obtained by consuming quantities w and  v of two goods. If a plane section of the utility function is taken at a given height (level of utility), the two-dimensional result is an indifference curve showing various alternative combinations of consumed amounts w and v of the two goods all of which give the specified level of utility.\n\n\n== Area and volume ==\nCavalieri's principle states that solids with corresponding cross-sections of equal areas have equal volumes.\nThe cross-sectional area (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A'}\n  ) of an object when viewed from a particular angle is the total area of the orthographic projection of the object from that angle. For example, a cylinder of height h and radius r has \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n        =\n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A'=\\pi r^{2}}\n   when viewed along its central axis, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n        =\n        2\n        r\n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A'=2rh}\n   when viewed from an orthogonal direction.

This concept has sometimes been used to help visualize aspects of higher dimensional spaces. For instance, if a four-dimensional object passed through our three-dimensional space, we would see a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional object. In particular, a 4-ball (hypersphere) passing through 3-space would appear as a 3-ball that increased to a maximum and then decreased in size during the transition. This dynamic object (from the point of view of 3-space) is a sequence of cross-sections of the 4-ball.\n\n\n== Examples in science ==\n\nIn geology, the structure of the interior of a planet is often illustrated using a diagram of a cross-section of the planet that passes through the planet's center, as in the cross-section of Earth at right.\nCross-sections are often used in anatomy to illustrate the inner structure of an organ, as shown at the left.\nA cross-section of a tree trunk, as shown at left, reveals growth rings that can be used to find the age of the tree and the temporal properties of its environment.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDescriptive geometry\nExploded-view drawing\nGraphical projection\nPlans (drawings)\nProfile gauge\nSection lining; representation of materials\nSecant plane\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAlbert, Abraham Adrian (2016) [1949], Solid Analytic Geometry, Dover, ISBN 978-0-486-81026-3\nStewart, Ian (2001), Flatterland / like flatland, only more so, Persus Publishing, ISBN 0-7382-0675-X\nSwokowski, Earl W.

If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. This article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry, and in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\n\n\n== Types of triangle ==\n\nThe terminology for categorizing triangles is more than two thousand years old, having been defined on the very first page of Euclid's Elements. The names used for modern classification are either a direct transliteration of Euclid's Greek or their Latin translations.\n\n\n=== By lengths of sides ===\nAncient Greek mathematician Euclid defined three types of triangle according to the lengths of their sides:\nGreek: \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f30\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f34\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2, \u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u1f72\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f34\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2, \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2, lit.\u2009'Of trilateral figures, an isopleuron [equilateral] triangle is that which has its three sides equal, an isosceles that which has two of its sides alone equal, and a scalene that which has its three sides unequal.'\nAn equilateral triangle (Greek: \u1f30\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, romanized: is\u00f3pleuron, lit.\u2009'equal sides') has three sides of the same length. An equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60\u00b0.\nAn isosceles triangle (Greek: \u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u1f72\u03c2, romanized: isoskel\u00e9s, lit.\u2009'equal legs') has two sides of equal length. An isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the two sides of the same length. This fact is the content of the isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45\u201345\u201390 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.\nA scalene triangle (Greek: \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd, romanized: skalin\u00f3n, lit.\u2009'unequal') has all its sides of different lengths. Equivalently, it has all angles of different measure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nHatch marks, also called tick marks, are used in diagrams of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths. A side can be marked with a pattern of \"ticks\", short line segments in the form of tally marks; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern. In a triangle, the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks. An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 sides, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 sides, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all sides since no sides are equal.\nSimilarly, patterns of 1, 2, or 3 concentric arcs inside the angles are used to indicate equal angles: an equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 angles, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 angles, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all angles, since no angles are equal.\n\n\n=== By internal angles ===\n\nTriangles can also be classified according to their internal angles, measured here in degrees.\n\nA right triangle (or right-angled triangle) has one of its interior angles measuring 90\u00b0 (a right angle). The side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse, the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are called the legs or catheti (singular: cathetus) of the triangle. Right triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse: a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. Special right triangles are right triangles with additional properties that make calculations involving them easier. One of the two most famous is the 3\u20134\u20135 right triangle, where 32 + 42 = 52. The 3\u20134\u20135 triangle is also known as the Egyptian triangle. In this situation, 3, 4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple. The other one is an isosceles triangle that has 2 angles measuring 45 degrees (45\u201345\u201390 triangle).\nTriangles that do not have an angle measuring 90\u00b0 are called oblique triangles.\nA triangle with all interior angles measuring less than 90\u00b0 is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. If c is the length of the longest side, then a2 + b2 > c2, where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.\nA triangle with one interior angle measuring more than 90\u00b0 is an obtuse triangle or obtuse-angled triangle. If c is the length of the longest side, then a2 + b2 < c2, where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.\nA triangle with an interior angle of 180\u00b0 (and collinear vertices) is degenerate. A right degenerate triangle has collinear vertices, two of which are coincident.A triangle that has two angles with the same measure also has two sides with the same length, and therefore it is an isosceles triangle. It follows that in a triangle where all angles have the same measure, all three sides have the same length, and therefore is equilateral.\n\n\n== Basic facts ==\n\nTriangles are assumed to be two-dimensional plane figures, unless the context provides otherwise (see \u00a7 Non-planar triangles, below). In rigorous treatments, a triangle is therefore called a 2-simplex (see also Polytope). Elementary facts about triangles were presented by Euclid, in books 1\u20134 of his Elements, written around 300 BC.\n\nThe sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space is always 180 degrees. This fact is equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. This allows determination of the measure of the third angle of any triangle, given the measure of two angles. An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.\n\n\n=== Similarity and congruence ===\nTwo triangles are said to be similar, if every angle of one triangle has the same measure as the corresponding angle in the other triangle. The corresponding sides of similar triangles have lengths that are in the same proportion, and this property is also sufficient to establish similarity.\nSome basic theorems about similar triangles are:\n\nIf and only if one pair of internal angles of two triangles have the same measure as each other, and another pair also have the same measure as each other, the triangles are similar.\nIf and only if one pair of corresponding sides of two triangles are in the same proportion as are another pair of corresponding sides, and their included angles have the same measure, then the triangles are similar. (The included angle for any two sides of a polygon is the internal angle between those two sides.)\nIf and only if three pairs of corresponding sides of two triangles are all in the same proportion, then the triangles are similar.Two triangles that are congruent have exactly the same size and shape: all pairs of corresponding interior angles are equal in measure, and all pairs of corresponding sides have the same length. (This is a total of six equalities, but three are often sufficient to prove congruence.)\nSome individually necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of triangles to be congruent are:\n\nSAS Postulate: Two sides in a triangle have the same length as two sides in the other triangle, and the included angles have the same measure.\nASA: Two interior angles and the included side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (The included side for a pair of angles is the side that is common to them.)\nSSS: Each side of a triangle has the same length as a corresponding side of the other triangle.\nAAS: Two angles and a corresponding (non-included) side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (This is sometimes referred to as AAcorrS and then includes ASA above.)Some individually sufficient conditions are:\n\nHypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem: The hypotenuse and a leg in a right triangle have the same length as those in another right triangle. This is also called RHS (right-angle, hypotenuse, side).\nHypotenuse-Angle Theorem: The hypotenuse and an acute angle in one right triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in the other right triangle. This is just a particular case of the AAS theorem.An important condition is:\n\nSide-Side-Angle (or Angle-Side-Side) condition: If two sides and a corresponding non-included angle of a triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in another triangle, then this is not sufficient to prove congruence; but if the angle given is opposite to the longer side of the two sides, then the triangles are congruent. The Hypotenuse-Leg Theorem is a particular case of this criterion. The Side-Side-Angle condition does not by itself guarantee that the triangles are congruent because one triangle could be obtuse-angled and the other acute-angled.Using right triangles and the concept of similarity, the trigonometric functions sine and cosine can be defined. These are functions of an angle which are investigated in trigonometry.\n\n\n=== Right triangles ===\n\nA central theorem is the Pythagorean theorem, which states in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two other sides. If the hypotenuse has length c, and the legs have lengths a and b, then the theorem states that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.}\n  The converse is true: if the lengths of the sides of a triangle satisfy the above equation, then the triangle has a right angle opposite side c.\nSome other facts about right triangles:\n\nThe acute angles of a right triangle are complementary.\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        +\n        b\n        +\n        \n          90\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          180\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        \u21d2\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        =\n        \n          90\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        \u21d2\n        a\n        =\n        \n          90\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a+b+90^{\\circ }=180^{\\circ }\\Rightarrow a+b=90^{\\circ }\\Rightarrow a=90^{\\circ }-b.}\n  If the legs of a right triangle have the same length, then the angles opposite those legs have the same measure. Since these angles are complementary, it follows that each measures 45 degrees. By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is the length of a leg times \u221a2.\nIn a right triangle with acute angles measuring 30 and 60 degrees, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter side, and the longer side is equal to the length of the shorter side times \u221a3:\n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        =\n        2\n        a\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c=2a\\,}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        =\n        a\n        \u00d7\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b=a\\times {\\sqrt {3}}.}\n  For all triangles, angles and sides are related by the law of cosines and law of sines (also called the cosine rule and sine rule).\n\n\n== Existence of a triangle ==\n\n\n=== Condition on the sides ===\nThe triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. That sum can equal the length of the third side only in the case of a degenerate triangle, one with collinear vertices. It is not possible for that sum to be less than the length of the third side. A triangle with three given positive side lengths exists if and only if those side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n\n=== Conditions on the angles ===\nThree given angles form a non-degenerate triangle (and indeed an infinitude of them) if and only if both of these conditions hold: (a) each of the angles is positive, and (b) the angles sum to 180\u00b0. If degenerate triangles are permitted, angles of 0\u00b0 are permitted.\n\n\n==== Trigonometric conditions ====\nThree positive angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, each of them less than 180\u00b0, are the angles of a triangle if and only if any one of the following conditions holds:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            2\n          \n        \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b2\n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b2\n            2\n          \n        \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b3\n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b3\n            2\n          \n        \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan {\\frac {\\alpha }{2}}\\tan {\\frac {\\beta }{2}}+\\tan {\\frac {\\beta }{2}}\\tan {\\frac {\\gamma }{2}}+\\tan {\\frac {\\gamma }{2}}\\tan {\\frac {\\alpha }{2}}=1,}\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b2\n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b3\n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            2\n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b2\n            2\n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \u03b3\n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{2}{\\frac {\\alpha }{2}}+\\sin ^{2}{\\frac {\\beta }{2}}+\\sin ^{2}{\\frac {\\gamma }{2}}+2\\sin {\\frac {\\alpha }{2}}\\sin {\\frac {\\beta }{2}}\\sin {\\frac {\\gamma }{2}}=1,}\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        2\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        +\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        2\n        \u03b2\n        )\n        +\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        2\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        =\n        4\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b2\n        )\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(2\\alpha )+\\sin(2\\beta )+\\sin(2\\gamma )=4\\sin(\\alpha )\\sin(\\beta )\\sin(\\gamma ),}\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          cos\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        \u03b1\n        +\n        \n          cos\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        \u03b2\n        +\n        \n          cos\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        \u03b3\n        +\n        2\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b2\n        )\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos ^{2}\\alpha +\\cos ^{2}\\beta +\\cos ^{2}\\gamma +2\\cos(\\alpha )\\cos(\\beta )\\cos(\\gamma )=1,}\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        +\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b2\n        )\n        +\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        =\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b1\n        )\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b2\n        )\n        tan\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan(\\alpha )+\\tan(\\beta )+\\tan(\\gamma )=\\tan(\\alpha )\\tan(\\beta )\\tan(\\gamma ),}\n  the last equality applying only if none of the angles is 90\u00b0 (so the tangent function's value is always finite).\n\n\n== Points, lines, and circles associated with a triangle ==\nThere are thousands of different constructions that find a special point associated with (and often inside) a triangle, satisfying some unique property: see the article Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers for a catalogue of them. Often they are constructed by finding three lines associated in a symmetrical way with the three sides (or vertices) and then proving that the three lines meet in a single point: an important tool for proving the existence of these is Ceva's theorem, which gives a criterion for determining when three such lines are concurrent. Similarly, lines associated with a triangle are often constructed by proving that three symmetrically constructed points are collinear: here Menelaus' theorem gives a useful general criterion. In this section just a few of the most commonly encountered constructions are explained.\n\nA perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is a straight line passing through the midpoint of the side and being perpendicular to it, i.e. forming a right angle with it. The three perpendicular bisectors meet in a single point, the triangle's circumcenter, usually denoted by O; this point is the center of the circumcircle, the circle passing through all three vertices. The diameter of this circle, called the \"circumdiameter\", can be found from the law of sines stated above. The circumcircle's radius is called the \"circumradius\".\nThales' theorem implies that if the circumcenter is located on a side of the triangle, then the opposite angle is a right one. If the circumcenter is located inside the triangle, then the triangle is acute; if the circumcenter is located outside the triangle, then the triangle is obtuse.\n\nAn altitude of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and perpendicular to (i.e. forming a right angle with) the opposite side. This opposite side is called the base of the altitude, and the point where the altitude intersects the base (or its extension) is called the foot of the altitude. The length of the altitude is the distance between the base and the vertex. The three altitudes intersect in a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle, usually denoted by H. The orthocenter lies inside the triangle if and only if the triangle is acute.\n\nAn angle bisector of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex which cuts the corresponding angle in half. The three angle bisectors intersect in a single point, the incenter, usually denoted by I, the center of the triangle's incircle. The incircle is the circle which lies inside the triangle and touches all three sides. Its radius is called the inradius. There are three other important circles, the excircles; they lie outside the triangle and touch one side as well as the extensions of the other two. The centers of the in- and excircles form an orthocentric system.\n\nA median of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, and divides the triangle into two equal areas. The three medians intersect in a single point, the triangle's centroid or geometric barycenter, usually denoted by G. The centroid of a rigid triangular object (cut out of a thin sheet of uniform density) is also its center of mass: the object can be balanced on its centroid in a uniform gravitational field. The centroid cuts every median in the ratio 2:1, i.e. the distance between a vertex and the centroid is twice the distance between the centroid and the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\nThe midpoints of the three sides and the feet of the three altitudes all lie on a single circle, the triangle's nine-point circle. The remaining three points for which it is named are the midpoints of the portion of altitude between the vertices and the orthocenter. The radius of the nine-point circle is half that of the circumcircle. It touches the incircle (at the Feuerbach point) and the three excircles.\n\nThe orthocenter (blue point), center of the nine-point circle (red), centroid (orange), and circumcenter (green) all lie on a single line, known as Euler's line (red line). The center of the nine-point circle lies at the midpoint between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and the distance between the centroid and the circumcenter is half that between the centroid and the orthocenter.\nThe center of the incircle is not in general located on Euler's line.\nIf one reflects a median in the angle bisector that passes through the same vertex, one obtains a symmedian. The three symmedians intersect in a single point, the symmedian point of the triangle.\n\n\n== Computing the sides and angles ==\nThere are various standard methods for calculating the length of a side or the measure of an angle. Certain methods are suited to calculating values in a right-angled triangle; more complex methods may be required in other situations.\n\n\n=== Trigonometric ratios in right triangles ===\n\nIn right triangles, the trigonometric ratios of sine, cosine and tangent can be used to find unknown angles and the lengths of unknown sides. The sides of the triangle are known as follows:\n\nThe hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, or defined as the longest side of a right-angled triangle, in this case h.\nThe opposite side is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in, in this case a.\nThe adjacent side is the side that is in contact with the angle we are interested in and the right angle, hence its name. In this case the adjacent side is b.\n\n\n==== Sine, cosine and tangent ====\nThe sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be sin \u03b1, sin \u03b2 and sin \u03b3. The side whose length is sin \u03b1 is opposite to the angle whose measure is \u03b1, etc.\nThe law of cosines, or cosine rule, connects the length of an unknown side of a triangle to the length of the other sides and the angle opposite to the unknown side.

Equality holds (exclusively) for a parallelogram.\n\n\n=== Hexagon ===\nThe Lemoine hexagon is a cyclic hexagon with vertices given by the six intersections of the sides of a triangle with the three lines that are parallel to the sides and that pass through its symmedian point. In either its simple form or its self-intersecting form, the Lemoine hexagon is interior to the triangle with two vertices on each side of the triangle.\n\n\n=== Squares ===\nEvery acute triangle has three inscribed squares (squares in its interior such that all four of a square's vertices lie on a side of the triangle, so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle). In a right triangle two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangle's right angle, so a right triangle has only two distinct inscribed squares. An obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle's longest side.  Within a given triangle, a longer common side is associated with a smaller inscribed square. If an inscribed square has side of length qa and the triangle has a side of length a, part of which side coincides with a side of the square, then qa, a, the altitude ha from the side a, and the triangle's area T are related according to\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          q\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              T\n              a\n            \n            \n              \n                a\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              2\n              T\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \n                h\n                \n                  a\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              a\n              +\n              \n                h\n                \n                  a\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle q_{a}={\\frac {2Ta}{a^{2}+2T}}={\\frac {ah_{a}}{a+h_{a}}}.}\n  The largest possible ratio of the area of the inscribed square to the area of the triangle is 1/2, which occurs when a2 = 2T, q = a/2, and the altitude of the triangle from the base of length a is equal to a. The smallest possible ratio of the side of one inscribed square to the side of another in the same non-obtuse triangle is \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        3\n        =\n        0.94....\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2{\\sqrt {2}}/3=0.94....}\n   Both of these extreme cases occur for the isosceles right triangle.\n\n\n=== Triangles ===\nFrom an interior point in a reference triangle, the nearest points on the three sides serve as the vertices of the pedal triangle of that point. If the interior point is the circumcenter of the reference triangle, the vertices of the pedal triangle are the midpoints of the reference triangle's sides, and so the pedal triangle is called the midpoint triangle or medial triangle. The midpoint triangle subdivides the reference triangle into four congruent triangles which are similar to the reference triangle.\nThe Gergonne triangle or intouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the three points of tangency of the reference triangle's sides with its incircle. The extouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the points of tangency of the reference triangle's excircles with its sides (not extended).\n\n\n== Figures circumscribed about a triangle ==\nThe tangential triangle of a reference triangle (other than a right triangle) is the triangle whose sides are on the tangent lines to the reference triangle's circumcircle at its vertices.\nAs mentioned above, every triangle has a unique circumcircle, a circle passing through all three vertices, whose center is the intersection of the  perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides.\nFurther, every triangle has a unique Steiner circumellipse, which passes through the triangle's vertices and has its center at the triangle's centroid. Of all ellipses going through the triangle's vertices, it has the smallest area.\nThe Kiepert hyperbola is the unique conic which passes through the triangle's three vertices, its centroid, and its circumcenter.\nOf all triangles contained in a given convex polygon, one with maximal area can be found in linear time; its vertices may be chosen as three of the vertices of the given polygon.\n\n\n== Specifying the location of a point in a triangle ==\nOne way to identify locations of points in (or outside) a triangle is to place the triangle in an arbitrary location and orientation in the Cartesian plane, and to use Cartesian coordinates. While convenient for many purposes, this approach has the disadvantage of all points' coordinate values being dependent on the arbitrary placement in the plane.\nTwo systems avoid that feature, so that the coordinates of a point are not affected by moving the triangle, rotating it, or reflecting it as in a mirror, any of which give a congruent triangle, or even by rescaling it to give a similar triangle:\n\nTrilinear coordinates specify the relative distances of a point from the sides, so that coordinates \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        :\n        y\n        :\n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x:y:z}\n   indicate that the ratio of the distance of the point from the first side to its distance from the second side is \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        :\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x:y}\n   , etc.\nBarycentric coordinates of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n        :\n        \u03b2\n        :\n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha :\\beta :\\gamma }\n   specify the point's location by the relative weights that would have to be put on the three vertices in order to balance the otherwise weightless triangle on the given point.\n\n\n== Non-planar triangles ==\nA non-planar triangle is a triangle which is not contained in a Euclidean plane. Some examples of non-planar triangles in non-Euclidean geometries are spherical triangles in spherical geometry and hyperbolic triangles in hyperbolic geometry.\nWhile the measures of the internal angles in planar triangles always sum to 180\u00b0, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180\u00b0, and a spherical triangle has measures of angles that sum to more than 180\u00b0. A hyperbolic triangle can be obtained by drawing on a negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface, and a spherical triangle can be obtained by drawing on a positively curved surface such as a sphere. Thus, if one draws a giant triangle on the surface of the Earth, one will find that the sum of the measures of its angles is greater than 180\u00b0; in fact it will be between 180\u00b0 and 540\u00b0. In particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles is equal to 90\u00b0, adding up to a total of 270\u00b0.\nSpecifically, on a sphere the sum of the angles of a triangle is\n\n180\u00b0 \u00d7 (1 + 4f),where f is the fraction of the sphere's area which is enclosed by the triangle. For example, suppose that we draw a triangle on the Earth's surface with vertices at the North Pole, at a point on the equator at 0\u00b0 longitude, and a point on the equator at 90\u00b0 West longitude. The great circle line between the latter two points is the equator, and the great circle line between either of those points and the North Pole is a line of longitude; so there are right angles at the two points on the equator. Moreover, the angle at the North Pole is also 90\u00b0 because the other two vertices differ by 90\u00b0 of longitude. So the sum of the angles in this triangle is 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 270\u00b0. The triangle encloses 1/4 of the northern hemisphere (90\u00b0/360\u00b0 as viewed from the North Pole) and therefore 1/8 of the Earth's surface, so in the formula f = 1/8; thus the formula correctly gives the sum of the triangle's angles as 270\u00b0.\nFrom the above angle sum formula we can also see that the Earth's surface is locally flat: If we draw an arbitrarily small triangle in the neighborhood of one point on the Earth's surface, the fraction f of the Earth's surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily close to zero. In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180\u00b0, which we know is what Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.\n\n\n== Triangles in construction ==\n\nRectangles have been the most popular and common geometric form for buildings since the shape is easy to stack and organize; as a standard, it is easy to design furniture and fixtures to fit inside rectangularly shaped buildings. But triangles, while more difficult to use conceptually, provide a great deal of strength. As computer technology helps architects design creative new buildings, triangular shapes are becoming increasingly prevalent as parts of buildings and as the primary shape for some types of skyscrapers as well as building materials. In Tokyo in 1989, architects had wondered whether it was possible to build a 500-story tower to provide affordable office space for this densely packed city, but with the danger to buildings from earthquakes, architects considered that a triangular shape would be necessary if such a building were to be built.In New York City, as Broadway crisscrosses major avenues, the resulting blocks are cut like triangles, and buildings have been built on these shapes; one such building is the triangularly shaped Flatiron Building which real estate people admit has a \"warren of awkward spaces that do not easily accommodate modern office furniture\" but that has not prevented the structure from becoming a landmark icon. Designers have made houses in Norway using triangular themes. Triangle shapes have appeared in churches as well as public buildings including colleges as well as supports for innovative home designs.Triangles are sturdy; while a rectangle can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure to one of its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. A triangle will not change shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, each of the three sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. Some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. It is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. It is important to remember that triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). Tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIvanov, A.B.

If f is any function of x, then the graph of the function f(x) + c (whose values are given by adding a constant c  to the values of f) may be obtained by a vertical translation of the graph of f(x) by distance c.  For this reason the function f(x) + c is sometimes called a vertical translate of f(x). For instance, the antiderivatives of a function all differ from each other by a constant of integration and are therefore vertical translates of each other.In function graphing, a horizontal translation is a transformation which results in a graph that is equivalent to shifting the base graph left or right in the direction of the x-axis. A graph is translated k units horizontally by moving each point on the graph k units horizontally.\nFor the base function f(x) and a constant k, the function given by g(x) = f(x \u2212 k), can be sketched f(x) shifted k units horizontally.\nIf function transformation was talked about in terms of geometric transformations it may be clearer why functions translate horizontally the way they do. When addressing translations on the Cartesian plane it is natural to introduce translations in this type of notation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        \u2192\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        a\n        ,\n        y\n        +\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y)\\rightarrow (x+a,y+b)}\n  or\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        a\n        ,\n        y\n        +\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T(x,y)=(x+a,y+b)}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   are horizontal and vertical changes respectively.\n\n\n==== Example ====\nTaking the parabola y = x2 , a horizontal translation 5 units to the right would be represented by T(x, y) = (x + 5, y). Now we must connect this transformation notation to an algebraic notation. Consider the point (a, b) on the original parabola that moves to point (c, d) on the translated parabola. According to our translation, c = a + 5  and d = b. The point on the original parabola was b = a2. Our new point can be described by relating d and c in the same equation. b = d and a = c \u2212 5.\nSo d = b = a2 = (c \u2212 5)2. Since this is true for all the points on our new parabola, the new equation is y = (x \u2212 5)2.\n\n\n=== Application in classical physics ===\nIn classical physics, translational motion is movement that changes the position of an object, as opposed to rotation. For example, according to Whittaker:\nIf a body is moved from one position to another, and if the lines joining the initial and final points of each of the points of the body are a set of parallel straight lines of length \u2113, so that the orientation of the body in space is unaltered, the displacement is called a translation parallel to the direction of the lines, through a distance \u2113. \nA translation is the operation changing the positions of all points \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y,z)}\n   of an object according to the formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \u2192\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        \u0394\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        +\n        \u0394\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        +\n        \u0394\n        z\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y,z)\\to (x+\\Delta x,y+\\Delta y,z+\\Delta z)}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u0394\n        x\n        ,\n         \n        \u0394\n        y\n        ,\n         \n        \u0394\n        z\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\Delta x,\\ \\Delta y,\\ \\Delta z)}\n   is the same vector for each point of the object. The translation vector \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u0394\n        x\n        ,\n         \n        \u0394\n        y\n        ,\n         \n        \u0394\n        z\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\Delta x,\\ \\Delta y,\\ \\Delta z)}\n   common to all points of the object describes a particular type of displacement of the object, usually called a linear displacement to distinguish it from displacements involving rotation, called angular displacements.\nWhen considering spacetime, a change of time coordinate is considered to be a translation.\n\n\n== As an operator ==\n\nThe translation operator turns a function of the original position, \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          v\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(\\mathbf {v} )}\n  , into a function of the final position, \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          v\n        \n        +\n        \n          \u03b4\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(\\mathbf {v} +\\mathbf {\\delta } )}\n  . In other words, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            \n              \u03b4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\mathbf {\\delta } }}\n   is defined such that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            \n              \u03b4\n            \n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        \n          v\n        \n        )\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        \n          v\n        \n        +\n        \n          \u03b4\n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\mathbf {\\delta } }f(\\mathbf {v} )=f(\\mathbf {v} +\\mathbf {\\delta } ).}\n   This operator is more abstract than a function, since \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            \n              \u03b4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\mathbf {\\delta } }}\n   defines a relationship between two functions, rather than the underlying vectors themselves. The translation operator can act on many kinds of functions, such as when the translation operator acts on a wavefunction, which is studied in the field of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n== As a group ==\n\nThe set of all translations forms the translation group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {T} }\n  , which is isomorphic to the space itself, and a normal subgroup of Euclidean group \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E(n)}\n  .

There are an infinite number of possible translations, so the translation group is an infinite group.\nIn the theory of relativity, due to the treatment of space and time as a single spacetime, translations can also refer to changes in the time coordinate. For example, the Galilean group and the Poincar\u00e9 group include translations with respect to time.\n\n\n=== Lattice groups ===\n\nOne kind of subgroup of the three-dimensional translation group are the lattice groups, which are infinite groups, but unlike the translation groups, are finitely generated. That is, a finite generating set generates the entire group.\n\n\n== Matrix representation ==\nA translation is an affine transformation with no fixed points. Matrix multiplications always have the origin as a fixed point. Nevertheless, there is a common workaround using homogeneous coordinates to represent a translation of a vector space with matrix multiplication: Write the 3-dimensional vector \n  \n    \n      \n

of translation matrices is therefore also commutative (unlike multiplication of arbitrary matrices).\n\n\n== Translation of axes ==\n\nWhile geometric translation is often viewed as an active process that changes the position of a geometric object, a similar result can be achieved by a passive transformation that moves the coordinate system itself but leaves the object fixed. The passive version of an active geometric translation is known as a translation of axes.\n\n\n== Translational symmetry ==\n\nAn object that looks the same before and after translation is said to have translational symmetry. A common example is a periodic function, which is an eigenfunction of a translation operator.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Vehicle dynamics ===\nFor describing vehicle dynamics (or movement of any rigid body), including ship dynamics and aircraft dynamics, it is common to use a mechanical model consisting of six degrees of freedom, which includes translations along three reference axes, as well as rotations about those three axes.\nThese translations are often called:\n\nSurge, translation along the longitudinal axis (forward or backwards)\nSway, translation along the transverse axis (from side to side)\nHeave, translation along the vertical axis (to move up or down).The corresponding rotations are often called:\n\nroll, about the longitudinal axis\npitch, about the transverse axis\nyaw, about the vertical axis.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nTranslation Transform at cut-the-knot\nGeometric Translation (Interactive Animation) at Math Is Fun\nUnderstanding 2D Translation and Understanding 3D Translation by Roger Germundsson, The Wolfram Demonstrations Project.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nZazkis, R., Liljedahl, P., & Gadowsky, K.

A truncated octagon, t{8} is a hexadecagon, {16}. A 3D analog of the octagon can be the rhombicuboctahedron with the triangular faces on it like the replaced edges, if one considers the octagon to be a truncated square.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe sum of all the internal angles of any octagon is 1080\u00b0. As with all polygons, the external angles total 360\u00b0.\nIf squares are constructed all internally or all externally on the sides of an octagon, then the midpoints of the segments connecting the centers of opposite squares form a quadrilateral that is both equidiagonal and orthodiagonal (that is, whose diagonals are equal in length and at right angles to each other).:\u200aProp. 9\u200aThe midpoint octagon of a reference octagon has its eight vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference octagon. If squares are constructed all internally or all externally on the sides of the midpoint octagon, then the midpoints of the segments connecting the centers of opposite squares themselves form the vertices of a square.:\u200aProp. 10\u200a\n\n\n=== Regularity ===\nA regular octagon is a closed figure with sides of the same length and internal angles of the same size. It has eight lines of reflective symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 8. A regular octagon is represented by the Schl\u00e4fli symbol {8}.\nThe internal angle at each vertex of a regular octagon is 135\u00b0 (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                3\n                \u03c0\n              \n              4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {\\frac {3\\pi }{4}}}\n   radians).

Twelve bars of size 4, three bars of size 5 and two bars of size 6 are required.\n\nEach side of a regular octagon subtends half a right angle at the centre of the circle which connects its vertices.  Its area can thus be computed as the sum of eight isosceles triangles, leading to the result:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Area\n        \n        =\n        2\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Area}}=2a^{2}({\\sqrt {2}}+1)}\n  for an octagon of side a.\n\n\n=== Standard coordinates ===\nThe coordinates for the vertices of a regular octagon centered at the origin and with side length 2 are:\n\n(\u00b11, \u00b1(1+\u221a2))\n(\u00b1(1+\u221a2), \u00b11).\n\n\n=== Dissectibility ===\nCoxeter states that every zonogon (a 2m-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into m(m-1)/2 parallelograms.\nIn particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the regular octagon, m=4, and it can be divided into 6 rhombs, with one example shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 6 of 24 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the tesseract. The list (sequence A006245 in the OEIS) defines the number of solutions as eight, by the eight orientations of this one dissection. These squares and rhombs are used in the Ammann\u2013Beenker tilings.\n\n\n== Skew ==\n\nA skew octagon is a skew polygon with eight vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an octagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag octagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew octagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In three dimensions it is a zig-zag skew octagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a square antiprism with the same D4d, [2+,8] symmetry, order 16.\n\n\n=== Petrie polygons ===\nThe regular skew octagon is the Petrie polygon for these higher-dimensional regular and uniform polytopes, shown in these skew orthogonal projections of in A7, B4, and D5 Coxeter planes.\n\n\n== Symmetry ==\nThe regular octagon has Dih8 symmetry, order 16. There are three dihedral subgroups: Dih4, Dih2, and Dih1, and four cyclic subgroups: Z8, Z4, Z2, and  Z1, the last implying no symmetry.\n\nOn the regular octagon, there are eleven distinct symmetries. John Conway labels full symmetry as r16. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars) Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders. Full symmetry of the regular form is r16 and no symmetry is labeled a1.\nThe most common high symmetry octagons are p8, an isogonal octagon constructed by four mirrors can alternate long and short edges, and d8, an isotoxal octagon constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular octagon.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g8 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.\n\n\n== Use ==\n\nThe octagonal shape is used as a design element in architecture. The Dome of the Rock has a characteristic octagonal plan. The Tower of the Winds in Athens is another example of an octagonal structure. The octagonal plan has also been in church architecture such as St. George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa, Basilica of San Vitale (in Ravenna, Italia), Castel del Monte (Apulia, Italia), Florence Baptistery, Zum Friedef\u00fcrsten Church (Germany) and a number of octagonal churches in Norway. The central space in the Aachen Cathedral, the Carolingian Palatine Chapel, has a regular octagonal floorplan.

If x, y, and z are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, with no side being greater than z, then the triangle inequality states that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        z\n        \u2264\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z\\leq x+y,}\n  with equality only in the degenerate case of a triangle with zero area.\nIn Euclidean geometry and some other geometries, the triangle inequality is a theorem about distances, and it is written using vectors and vector lengths (norms):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        \n          x\n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n        \n        \u2016\n        \u2264\n        \u2016\n        \n          x\n        \n        \u2016\n        +\n        \u2016\n        \n          y\n        \n        \u2016\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\|\\mathbf {x} +\\mathbf {y} \\|\\leq \\|\\mathbf {x} \\|+\\|\\mathbf {y} \\|,}\n  where the length z of the third side has been replaced by the vector sum x + y. When x and y are real numbers, they can be viewed as vectors in R1, and the triangle inequality expresses a relationship between absolute values.\nIn Euclidean geometry, for right triangles the triangle inequality is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem, and for general triangles, a consequence of the law of cosines. For the law of cosines to prove triangle-inequality, the angle in a triangle is lower bounded by zero, so the cosine term is at most one, and the side length of the third side follows. It may be proved without these theorems. The inequality can be viewed intuitively in either R2 or R3. The figure at the right shows three examples beginning with clear inequality (top) and approaching equality (bottom). In the Euclidean case, equality occurs only if the triangle has a 180\u00b0 angle and two 0\u00b0 angles, making the three vertices collinear, as shown in the bottom example. Thus, in Euclidean geometry, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\nIn spherical geometry, the shortest distance between two points is an arc of a great circle, but the triangle inequality holds provided the restriction is made that the distance between two points on a sphere is the length of a minor spherical line segment (that is, one with central angle in [0, \u03c0]) with those endpoints.The triangle inequality is a defining property of norms and measures of distance. This property must be established as a theorem for any function proposed for such purposes for each particular space: for example, spaces such as the real numbers, Euclidean spaces, the Lp spaces (p \u2265 1), and inner product spaces.\n\n\n== Euclidean geometry ==\n\nEuclid proved the triangle inequality for distances in plane geometry using the construction in the figure. Beginning with triangle ABC, an isosceles triangle is constructed with one side taken as BC and the other equal leg BD along the extension of side AB. It then is argued that angle \u03b2 has larger measure than angle \u03b1, so side AD is longer than side AC. But AD = AB + BD = AB + BC, so the sum of the lengths of sides AB and BC is larger than the length of AC. This proof appears in Euclid's Elements, Book 1, Proposition 20.\n\n\n=== Mathematical expression of the constraint on the sides of a triangle ===\nFor a proper triangle, the triangle inequality, as stated in words, literally translates into three inequalities (given that a proper triangle has side lengths a, b, c that are all positive and excludes the degenerate case of zero area):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        +\n        b\n        >\n        c\n        ,\n        \n        b\n        +\n        c\n        >\n        a\n        ,\n        \n        c\n        +\n        a\n        >\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a+b>c,\\quad b+c>a,\\quad c+a>b.}\n  A more succinct form of this inequality system can be shown to be\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        a\n        \u2212\n        b\n        \n          |\n        \n        <\n        c\n        <\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |a-b|<c<a+b.}\n  Another way to state it is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        max\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        <\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        +\n        c\n        \u2212\n        max\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\max(a,b,c)<a+b+c-\\max(a,b,c)}\n  implying\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        max\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        <\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\max(a,b,c)<a+b+c}\n  and thus that the longest side length is less than the semiperimeter.\nA mathematically equivalent formulation is that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c must be a real number greater than zero.

Consequently, r is limited to the range 1/t < r < t where t is the tribonacci constant.\n\n\n==== Relationship with shortest paths ====\n\nThis generalization can be used to prove that the shortest curve between two points in Euclidean geometry is a straight line.\nNo polygonal path between two points is shorter than the line between them. This implies that no curve can have an arc length less than the distance between its endpoints. By definition, the arc length of a curve is the least upper bound of the lengths of all polygonal approximations of the curve. The result for polygonal paths shows that the straight line between the endpoints is the shortest of all the polygonal approximations. Because the arc length of the curve is greater than or equal to the length of every polygonal approximation, the curve itself cannot be shorter than the straight line path.\n\n\n=== Converse ===\nThe converse of the triangle inequality theorem is also true: if three real numbers are such that each is less than the sum of the others, then there exists a triangle with these numbers as its side lengths and with positive area; and if one number equals the sum of the other two, there exists a degenerate triangle (that is, with zero area) with these numbers as its side lengths.\nIn either case, if the side lengths are a, b, c we can attempt to place a triangle in the Euclidean plane as shown in the diagram. We need to prove that there exists a real number h consistent with the values a, b, and c, in which case this triangle exists.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem we have b2 = h2 + d2 and a2 = h2 + (c \u2212 d)2 according to the figure at the right. Subtracting these yields a2 \u2212 b2 = c2 \u2212 2cd.

Therefore there does exist a real number h consistent with the sides a, b, c, and the triangle exists. If each triangle inequality holds strictly, h > 0 and the triangle is non-degenerate (has positive area); but if one of the inequalities holds with equality, so h = 0, the triangle is degenerate.\n\n\n=== Generalization to higher dimensions ===\n\nThe area of a triangular face of a tetrahedron is less than or equal to the sum of the areas of the other three triangular faces.  More generally, in Euclidean space the hypervolume of an (n \u2212 1)-facet of an n-simplex is less than or equal to the sum of the hypervolumes of the other n facets.  \nMuch as the triangle inequality generalizes to a polygon inequality, the inequality for a simplex of any dimension generalizes to a polytope of any dimension: the hypervolume of any facet of a polytope is less than or equal to the sum of the hypervolumes of the remaining facets.\nIn some cases the tetrahedral inequality is stronger than several applications of the triangle inequality.  For example, the triangle inequality appears to allow the possibility of four points A, B, C, and Z in Euclidean space such that distances\n\nAB = BC = CA = 26and\n\nAZ = BZ = CZ = 14.However, points with such distances cannot exist: the area of the 26\u201326\u201326 equilateral triangle ABC is 169\u221a3, which is larger than three times 39\u221a3, the area of a 26\u201314\u201314 isosceles triangle (all by Heron's formula), and so the arrangement is forbidden by the tetrahedral inequality.\n\n\n== Normed vector space ==\n\nIn a normed vector space V, one of the defining properties of the norm is the triangle inequality:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        \u2016\n        \u2264\n        \u2016\n        x\n        \u2016\n        +\n        \u2016\n        y\n        \u2016\n        \n        \u2200\n        \n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        \u2208\n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\|x+y\\|\\leq \\|x\\|+\\|y\\|\\quad \\forall \\,x,y\\in V}\n  that is, the norm of the sum of two vectors is at most as large as the sum of the norms of the two vectors.

For p = 2 the p-norm becomes the Euclidean norm:  which is Pythagoras' theorem in n-dimensions, a very special case corresponding to an inner product norm. Except for the case p = 2, the p-norm is not an inner product norm, because it does not satisfy the parallelogram law. The triangle inequality for general values of p is called Minkowski's inequality. It takes the form:\n\n\n== Metric space ==\nIn a metric space M with metric d, the triangle inequality is a requirement upon distance:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n         \n        z\n        )\n        \u2264\n        d\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n         \n        y\n        )\n        +\n        d\n        (\n        y\n        ,\n         \n        z\n        )\n         \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d(x,\\ z)\\leq d(x,\\ y)+d(y,\\ z)\\ ,}\n  for all x, y, z in M. That is, the distance from x to z is at most as large as the sum of the distance from x to y and the distance from y to z.\nThe triangle inequality is responsible for most of the interesting structure on a metric space, namely, convergence.  This is because the remaining requirements for a metric are rather simplistic in comparison.  For example, the fact that any convergent sequence in a metric space is a Cauchy sequence is a direct consequence of the triangle inequality, because if we choose any xn and xm such that d(xn, x) < \u03b5/2 and d(xm, x) < \u03b5/2, where \u03b5 > 0 is given and arbitrary (as in the definition of a limit in a metric space), then by the triangle inequality, d(xn, xm) \u2264 d(xn, x) + d(xm, x) < \u03b5/2 + \u03b5/2 = \u03b5, so that the sequence {xn} is a Cauchy sequence, by definition.\nThis version of the triangle inequality reduces to the one stated above in case of normed vector spaces where a metric is induced via d(x, y) \u2254 \u2016x \u2212 y\u2016, with x \u2212 y being the vector pointing from point y to x.\n\n\n== Reverse triangle inequality ==\nThe reverse triangle inequality is an elementary consequence of the triangle inequality that gives lower bounds instead of upper bounds. For plane geometry, the statement is:\nAny side of a triangle is greater than or equal to the difference between the other two sides.In the case of a normed vector space, the statement is:\n\n  \n

reverse triangle inequality for arc lengths and employing the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosines, it follows immediately that\n\nand\n\nWith these formulas, one needs to compute a square root for each triple of vectors {x, y, z} that is examined rather than arccos(sim(x,y)) for each pair of vectors {x, y} examined, and could be a performance improvement when the number of triples examined is less than the number of pairs examined.\n\n\n== Reversal in Minkowski space ==\nThe Minkowski space metric \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n

The same reversed form of the inequality holds if both vectors lie in the past light cone, and if one or both are null vectors. The result holds in n + 1 dimensions for any n \u2265 1.

Where each line cuts the circle is a vertex of the decagon.  In other words,  the image of a regular pentagon under a point reflection with respect of its center is a concentric congruent pentagon,  and the two pentagons have in total the vertices of a concentric regular decagon.\nThe five corners of the pentagon constitute alternate corners of the decagon.

There are 3 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih5, Dih2, and Dih1, and 4 cyclic group symmetries: Z10, Z5, Z2, and Z1.\nThese 8 symmetries can be seen in 10 distinct symmetries on the decagon, a larger number because the lines of reflections can either pass through vertices or edges. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r20 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g10 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.\nThe highest symmetry irregular decagons are d10, an isogonal decagon constructed by five mirrors which can alternate long and short edges, and p10, an isotoxal decagon, constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular decagon.\n\n\n== Dissection ==\nCoxeter states that every zonogon (a 2m-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into m(m-1)/2 parallelograms.\nIn particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the regular decagon, m=5, and it can be divided into 10 rhombs, with examples shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 10 of 80 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the 5-cube. A dissection is based on 10 of 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron. The list OEIS: A006245 defines the number of solutions as 62, with 2 orientations for the first symmetric form, and 10 orientations for the other 6.\n\n\n== Skew decagon ==\nA skew decagon is a skew polygon with 10 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an decagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag decagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew decagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew decagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a pentagonal antiprism, pentagrammic antiprism, and pentagrammic crossed-antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20.\nThese can also be seen in these 4 convex polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry. The polygons on the perimeter of these projections are regular skew decagons.\n\n\n=== Petrie polygons ===\nThe regular skew decagon is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, shown in these orthogonal projections in various Coxeter planes: The number of sides in the Petrie polygon is equal to the Coxeter number, h, for each symmetry family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDecagonal number and centered decagonal number, figurate numbers modeled on the decagon\nDecagram, a star polygon with the same vertex positions as the regular decagon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Decagon\". MathWorld.\nDefinition and properties of a decagon With interactive animation", "Rotation_(mathematics)": "Rotation in mathematics is a concept originating in geometry. Any rotation is a motion of a certain space that preserves at least one point. It can describe, for example, the motion of a rigid body around a fixed point. Rotation can have sign (as in the sign of an angle): a clockwise rotation is a negative magnitude so a counterclockwise turn has a positive magnitude.\nA rotation is different from other types of motions: translations, which have no fixed points, and (hyperplane) reflections, each of them having an entire (n\u2009\u2212\u20091)-dimensional flat of fixed points in a n-dimensional space. \nMathematically, a rotation is a map. All rotations about a fixed point form a group under composition called the rotation group (of a particular space). But in mechanics and, more generally, in physics, this concept is frequently understood as a coordinate transformation (importantly, a transformation of an orthonormal basis), because for any motion of a body there is an inverse transformation which if applied to the frame of reference results in the body being at the same coordinates. For example, in two dimensions rotating a body clockwise about a point keeping the axes fixed is equivalent to rotating the axes counterclockwise about the same point while the body is kept fixed.  These two types of rotation are called active and passive transformations.\n\n\n== Related definitions and terminology ==\nThe rotation group is a Lie group of rotations about a fixed point. This (common) fixed point is called the center of rotation and is usually identified with the origin. The rotation group is a point stabilizer in a broader group of (orientation-preserving) motions.\nFor a particular rotation:\n\nThe axis of rotation is a line of its fixed points. They exist only in n > 2.\nThe plane of rotation is a plane that is invariant under the rotation. Unlike the axis, its points are not fixed themselves. The axis (where present) and the plane of a rotation are orthogonal.A representation of rotations is a particular formalism, either algebraic or geometric, used to parametrize a rotation map. This meaning is somehow inverse to the meaning in the group theory.\nRotations of (affine) spaces of points and of respective vector spaces are not always clearly distinguished. The former are sometimes referred to as affine rotations (although the term is misleading), whereas the latter are vector rotations. See the article below for details.\n\n\n== Definitions and representations ==\n\n\n=== In Euclidean geometry ===\n\nA motion of a Euclidean space is the same as its isometry: it leaves the distance between any two points unchanged after the transformation. But a (proper) rotation also has to preserve the orientation structure. The \"improper rotation\" term refers to isometries that reverse (flip) the orientation. In the language of group theory the distinction is expressed as direct vs indirect isometries in the Euclidean group, where the former comprise the identity component. Any direct Euclidean motion can be represented as a composition of a rotation about the fixed point and a translation.\nThere are no non-trivial rotations in one dimension. In two dimensions, only a single angle is needed to specify a rotation about the origin \u2013 the angle of rotation that specifies an element of the circle group (also known as U(1)). The rotation is acting to rotate an object counterclockwise through an angle \u03b8 about the origin; see below for details. Composition of rotations sums their angles modulo 1 turn, which implies that all two-dimensional rotations about the same point commute. Rotations about different points, in general, do not commute. Any two-dimensional direct motion is either a translation or a rotation; see Euclidean plane isometry for details.\n\nRotations in three-dimensional space differ from those in two dimensions in a number of important ways. Rotations in three dimensions are generally not commutative, so the order in which rotations are applied is important even about the same point. Also, unlike the two-dimensional case, a three-dimensional direct motion, in general position, is not a rotation but a screw operation. Rotations about the origin have three degrees of freedom (see rotation formalisms in three dimensions for details), the same as the number of dimensions.\nA three-dimensional rotation can be specified in a number of ways. The most usual methods are:\n\nEuler angles (pictured at the left). Any rotation about the origin can be represented as the composition of three rotations defined as the motion obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system because angles are measured with respect to a mix of different reference frames, rather than a single frame that is purely external or purely intrinsic. Specifically, the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third is an intrinsic rotation (a spin) around an axis fixed in the body that moves. Euler angles are typically denoted as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, or \u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8. This presentation is convenient only for rotations about a fixed point.\nAxis\u2013angle representation (pictured at the right) specifies an angle with the axis about which the rotation takes place. It can be easily visualised. There are two variants to represent it:\nas a pair consisting of the angle and a unit vector for the axis, or\nas a Euclidean vector obtained by multiplying the angle with this unit vector, called the rotation vector (although, strictly speaking, it is a pseudovector).\nMatrices, versors (quaternions), and other algebraic things: see the section Linear and Multilinear Algebra Formalism for details.\nA general rotation in four dimensions has only one fixed point, the centre of rotation, and no axis of rotation; see rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space for details. Instead the rotation has two mutually orthogonal planes of rotation, each of which is fixed in the sense that points in each plane stay within the planes. The rotation has two angles of rotation, one for each plane of rotation, through which points in the planes rotate. If these are \u03c91 and \u03c92 then all points not in the planes rotate through an angle between \u03c91 and \u03c92. Rotations in four dimensions about a fixed point have six degrees of freedom. A four-dimensional direct motion in general position is a rotation about certain point (as in all even Euclidean dimensions), but screw operations exist also.\n\n\n=== Linear and multilinear algebra formalism ===\n\nWhen one considers motions of the Euclidean space that preserve the origin, the distinction between points and vectors, important in pure mathematics, can be erased because there is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between points and position vectors. The same is true for geometries other than Euclidean, but whose space is an affine space with a supplementary structure; see an example below. Alternatively, the vector description of rotations can be understood as a parametrization of geometric rotations up to their composition with translations. In other words, one vector rotation presents many equivalent rotations about all points in the space.\nA motion that preserves the origin is the same as a linear operator on vectors that preserves the same geometric structure but expressed in terms of vectors. For Euclidean vectors, this expression is their magnitude (Euclidean norm). In components, such operator is expressed with n\u2009\u00d7\u2009n orthogonal matrix that is multiplied to column vectors.\nAs it was already stated, a (proper) rotation is different from an arbitrary fixed-point motion in its preservation of the orientation of the vector space. Thus, the determinant of a rotation orthogonal matrix must be 1. The only other possibility for the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is \u22121, and this result means the transformation is a hyperplane reflection, a point reflection (for odd n), or another kind of improper rotation. Matrices of all proper rotations form the special orthogonal group.\n\n\n==== Two dimensions ====\n\nIn two dimensions, to carry out a rotation using a matrix, the point (x,\u2009y) to be rotated counterclockwise is written as a column vector, then multiplied by a rotation matrix calculated from the angle \u03b8:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            [\n            \n

The matrix A is a member of the three-dimensional special orthogonal group, SO(3), that is it is an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1. That it is an orthogonal matrix means that its rows are a set of orthogonal unit vectors (so they are an orthonormal basis) as are its columns, making it simple to spot and check if a matrix is a valid rotation matrix.\nAbove-mentioned Euler angles and axis\u2013angle representations can be easily converted to a rotation matrix.\nAnother possibility to represent a rotation of three-dimensional Euclidean vectors are quaternions described below.\n\n\n==== Quaternions ====\n\nUnit quaternions, or versors, are in some ways the least intuitive representation of three-dimensional rotations. They are not the three-dimensional instance of a general approach. They are more compact than matrices and easier to work with than all other methods, so are often preferred in real-world applications.A versor (also called a rotation quaternion) consists of four real numbers, constrained so the norm of the quaternion is 1. This constraint limits the degrees of freedom of the quaternion to three, as required. Unlike matrices and complex numbers two multiplications are needed:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            x\n            \u2032\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            q\n            x\n            q\n          \n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x'} =\\mathbf {qxq} ^{-1},}\n  where q is the versor, q\u22121 is its inverse, and x is the vector treated as a quaternion with zero scalar part. The quaternion can be related to the rotation vector form of the axis angle rotation by the exponential map over the quaternions,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          q\n        \n        =\n        \n          e\n          \n            \n              v\n            \n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {q} =e^{\\mathbf {v} /2},}\n  where v is the rotation vector treated as a quaternion.\nA single multiplication by a versor, either left or right, is itself a rotation, but in four dimensions. Any four-dimensional rotation about the origin can be represented with two quaternion multiplications: one left and one right, by two different unit quaternions.\n\n\n==== Further notes ====\nMore generally, coordinate rotations in any dimension are represented by orthogonal matrices.  The set of all orthogonal matrices in n dimensions which describe proper rotations (determinant = +1), together with the operation of matrix multiplication, forms the special orthogonal group SO(n).\nMatrices are often used for doing transformations, especially when a large number of points are being transformed, as they are a direct representation of the linear operator. Rotations represented in other ways are often converted to matrices before being used. They can be extended to represent rotations and transformations at the same time using homogeneous coordinates. Projective transformations are represented by 4\u00d74 matrices. They are not rotation matrices, but a transformation that represents a Euclidean rotation has a 3\u00d73 rotation matrix in the upper left corner.\nThe main disadvantage of matrices is that they are more expensive to calculate and do calculations with. Also in calculations where numerical instability is a concern matrices can be more prone to it, so calculations to restore orthonormality, which are expensive to do for matrices, need to be done more often.\n\n\n==== More alternatives to the matrix formalism ====\nAs was demonstrated above, there exist three multilinear algebra rotation formalisms: one with U(1), or complex numbers, for two dimensions, and two others with versors, or quaternions, for three and four dimensions.\nIn general (even for vectors equipped with a non-Euclidean Minkowski quadratic form) the rotation of a vector space can be expressed as a bivector. This formalism is used in geometric algebra and, more generally, in the Clifford algebra representation of Lie groups.\nIn the case of a positive-definite Euclidean quadratic form, the double covering group of the isometry group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          O\n        \n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {SO} (n)}\n   is known as the Spin group, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          p\n          i\n          n\n        \n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Spin} (n)}\n  . It can be conveniently described in terms of a Clifford algebra.

For odd n, most of these motions do not have fixed points on the n-sphere and, strictly speaking, are not rotations of the sphere; such motions are sometimes referred to as Clifford translations. Rotations about a fixed point in elliptic and hyperbolic geometries are not different from Euclidean ones.Affine geometry and projective geometry have not a distinct notion of rotation.\n\n\n=== In relativity ===\n\nA generalization of a rotation applies in special relativity, where it can be considered to operate on a four-dimensional space, spacetime, spanned by three space dimensions and one of time. In special relativity, this space is called Minkowski space, and the four-dimensional rotations, called Lorentz transformations, have a physical interpretation. These transformations preserve a quadratic form called the spacetime interval.\nIf a rotation of Minkowski space is in a space-like plane, then this rotation is the same as a spatial rotation in Euclidean space. By contrast, a rotation in a plane spanned by a space-like dimension and a time-like dimension is a hyperbolic rotation, and if this plane contains the time axis of the reference frame, is called a \"Lorentz boost\". These transformations demonstrate the pseudo-Euclidean nature of the Minkowski space. Hyperbolic rotations are sometimes described as squeeze mappings and frequently appear on Minkowski diagrams that visualize (1 + 1)-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean geometry on planar drawings. The study of relativity is deals with the Lorentz group generated by the space rotations and hyperbolic rotations.Whereas SO(3) rotations, in physics and astronomy, correspond to rotations of celestial sphere as a 2-sphere in the Euclidean 3-space, Lorentz transformations from SO(3;1)+ induce conformal transformations of the celestial sphere. It is a broader class of the sphere transformations known as M\u00f6bius transformations.\n\n\n=== Discrete rotations ===\n\n\n== Importance ==\nRotations define important classes of symmetry: rotational symmetry is an invariance with respect to a particular rotation. The circular symmetry is an invariance with respect to all rotation about the fixed axis.\nAs was stated above, Euclidean rotations are applied to rigid body dynamics. Moreover, most of mathematical formalism in physics (such as the vector calculus) is rotation-invariant; see rotation for more physical aspects. Euclidean rotations and, more generally, Lorentz symmetry described above are thought to be symmetry laws of nature. In contrast, the reflectional symmetry is not a precise symmetry law of nature.\n\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThe complex-valued matrices analogous to real orthogonal matrices are the unitary matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          U\n        \n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {U} (n)}\n  , which represent rotations in complex space.  The set of all unitary matrices in a given dimension n forms a unitary group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          U\n        \n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {U} (n)}\n   of degree n; and its subgroup representing proper rotations (those that preserve the orientation of space) is the special unitary group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          U\n        \n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {SU} (n)}\n   of degree n.

Albuquerque: Sandia National Laboratories.", "Self-similarity": "In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e., the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales. Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals. Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample, whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.\nA time developing phenomenon is said to exhibit self-similarity if the numerical value of certain observable quantity \n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,t)}\n   measured at different times are different but the corresponding dimensionless quantity at given value of \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          t\n          \n            z\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x/t^{z}}\n   remain invariant. It happens if the quantity \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,t)}\n   exhibits dynamic scaling. The idea is just an extension of the idea of similarity of two triangles. Note that two triangles are similar if the numerical values of their sides are different however the corresponding dimensionless quantities, such as their angles, coincide.\nPeitgen et al. explain the concept as such:\n\nIf parts of a figure are small replicas of the whole, then the figure is called self-similar....A figure is strictly self-similar if the figure can be decomposed into parts which are exact replicas of the whole. Any arbitrary part contains an exact replica of the whole figure.Since mathematically, a fractal may show self-similarity under indefinite magnification, it is impossible to recreate this physically. Peitgen et al. suggest studying self-similarity using approximations:In order to give an operational meaning to the property of self-similarity, we are necessarily restricted to dealing with finite approximations of the limit figure. This is done using the method which we will call box self-similarity where measurements are made on finite stages of the figure using grids of various sizes.\nThis vocabulary was introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1964.\n\n\n== Self-affinity ==\n\nIn mathematics, self-affinity is a feature of a fractal whose pieces are scaled by different amounts in the x- and y-directions. This means that to appreciate the self similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an anisotropic affine transformation.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nA compact topological space X is self-similar if there exists a finite set S indexing a set of non-surjective homeomorphisms \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          f\n          \n            s\n          \n        \n        :\n        s\n        \u2208\n        S\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{f_{s}:s\\in S\\}}\n   for which\n\n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        =\n        \n          \u22c3\n          \n            s\n            \u2208\n            S\n          \n        \n        \n          f\n          \n            s\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X=\\bigcup _{s\\in S}f_{s}(X)}\n  If \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        \u2282\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X\\subset Y}\n  , we call X self-similar if it is the only non-empty subset of Y such that the equation above holds for \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          f\n          \n            s\n          \n        \n        :\n        s\n        \u2208\n        S\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{f_{s}:s\\in S\\}}\n  .

The homeomorphisms may be iterated, resulting in an iterated function system. The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid. When the set S has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid. The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree; more generally, if the set S has p elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.\nThe automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.\nA more general notion than self-similarity is Self-affinity.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points.\nSelf-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering, packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar.  This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.\nSimilarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity, i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown. Andrew Lo  describes stock market log return self-similarity in  econometrics.Finite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle.\n\n\n=== In cybernetics ===\nThe viable system model of Stafford Beer is an organizational model with an affine self-similar hierarchy, where a given viable system is one element of the System One of a viable system one recursive level higher up, and for whom the elements of its System One are viable systems one recursive level lower down.\n\n\n=== In nature ===\n\nSelf-similarity can be found in nature, as well. To the right is a mathematically generated, perfectly self-similar image of a fern, which bears a marked resemblance to natural ferns. Other plants, such as Romanesco broccoli, exhibit strong self-similarity.\n\n\n=== In music ===\nStrict canons display various types and amounts of self-similarity, as do sections of fugues.\nA Shepard tone is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.\nThe Danish composer Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd has made use of a self-similar integer sequence named the 'infinity series' in much of his music.\nIn the research field of music information retrieval, self-similarity commonly refers to the fact that music often consists of parts that are repeated in time. In other words, music is self-similar under temporal translation, rather than (or in addition to) under scaling.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Copperplate Chevrons\" \u2014 a self-similar fractal zoom movie\n\"Self-Similarity\" \u2014 New articles about Self-Similarity.

When D is external to the segment BC, directed line segments and directed angles must be used in the calculation.\nThe angle bisector theorem is commonly used when the angle bisectors and side lengths are known. It can be used in a calculation or in a proof.\nAn immediate consequence of the theorem is that the angle bisector of the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle will also bisect the opposite side.\n\n\n== Proofs ==\nThere exist many different ways of proving the angle bisector theorem.

According to Heath (1956, p. 197 (vol. 2)), the corresponding statement for an external angle bisector was given by Robert Simson who noted that Pappus assumed this result without proof. Heath goes on to say that Augustus De Morgan proposed that the two statements should be combined as follows:\nIf an angle of a triangle is bisected internally or externally by a straight line which cuts the opposite side or the opposite side produced, the segments of that side will have the same ratio as the other sides of the triangle; and, if a side of a triangle be divided internally or externally so that its segments have the same ratio as the other sides of the triangle, the straight line drawn from the point of section to the angular point which is opposite to the first mentioned side will bisect the interior or exterior angle at that angular point.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThis theorem has been used to prove the following theorems/results:\n\nCoordinates of the incenter of a triangle\nCircles of Apollonius\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nG.W.I.S Amarasinghe: On the Standard Lengths of Angle Bisectors and the Angle Bisector Theorem, Global Journal of Advanced Research on Classical and Modern Geometries, Vol 01(01), pp. 15 \u2013 27, 2012\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Property of Angle Bisectors at cut-the-knot\nIntro to angle bisector theorem at Khan Academy", "Star_polygon": "In geometry, a star polygon is a type of non-convex polygon. Regular star polygons have been studied in depth; while star polygons in general appear not to have been formally defined, certain notable ones can arise through truncation operations on regular simple and star polygons. \nBranko Gr\u00fcnbaum identified two primary definitions used by Johannes Kepler, one being the regular star polygons with intersecting edges that don't generate new vertices, and the second being simple isotoxal concave polygons.The first usage is included in polygrams which includes polygons like the pentagram but also compound figures like the hexagram.\nOne definition of a star polygon, used in turtle graphics, is a polygon having 2 or more turns (turning number and density), like in spirolaterals.\n\n\n== Names ==\nStar polygon names combine a numeral prefix, such as penta-, with the Greek suffix -gram (in this case generating the word pentagram). The prefix is normally a Greek cardinal, but synonyms using other prefixes exist. For example, a nine-pointed polygon or enneagram is also known as a nonagram, using the ordinal nona from Latin. The -gram suffix derives from \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ae (gramm\u1e17) meaning a line.\n\n\n== Regular star polygon ==\n\nA \"regular star polygon\" is a self-intersecting, equilateral equiangular polygon.\nA regular star polygon is denoted by its Schl\u00e4fli symbol {p/q}, where p (the number of vertices) and q (the density) are relatively prime (they share no factors) and q \u2265 2. The density of a polygon can also be called its turning number, the sum of the turn angles of all the vertices divided by 360\u00b0. \nThe symmetry group of {n/k} is dihedral group Dn of order 2n, independent of k.\nRegular star polygons were first studied systematically by Thomas Bradwardine, and later Johannes Kepler.\n\n\n=== Construction via vertex connection ===\nRegular star polygons can be created by connecting one vertex of a simple, regular, p-sided polygon to another, non-adjacent vertex and continuing the process until the original vertex is reached again. Alternatively for integers p and q, it can be considered as being constructed by connecting every qth point out of p points regularly spaced in a circular placement. For instance, in a regular pentagon, a five-pointed star can be obtained by drawing a line from the first to the third vertex, from the third vertex to the fifth vertex, from the fifth vertex to the second vertex, from the second vertex to the fourth vertex, and from the fourth vertex to the first vertex. \nIf q is greater than half of p, then the construction will result in the same polygon as p-q; connecting every third vertex of the pentagon will yield an identical result to that of connecting every second vertex. However, the vertices will be reached in the opposite direction, which makes a difference when retrograde polygons are incorporated in higher-dimensional polytopes. For example, an antiprism formed from a prograde pentagram {5/2} results in a pentagrammic antiprism; the analogous construction from a retrograde \"crossed pentagram\" {5/3} results in a pentagrammic crossed-antiprism. Another example is the tetrahemihexahedron, which can be seen as a \"crossed triangle\" {3/2} cuploid.\n\n\n==== Degenerate regular star polygons ====\nIf p and q are not coprime, a degenerate polygon will result with coinciding vertices and edges. For example {6/2} will appear as a triangle, but can be labeled with two sets of vertices 1-6. This should be seen not as two overlapping triangles, but a double-winding of a single unicursal hexagon.\n\n\n=== Construction via stellation ===\nAlternatively, a regular star polygon can also be obtained as a sequence of stellations of a convex regular core polygon. Constructions based on stellation also allow for regular polygonal compounds to be obtained in cases where the density and amount of vertices are not coprime. When constructing star polygons from stellation, however, if q is greater than p/2, the lines will instead diverge infinitely, and if q is equal to p/2, the lines will be parallel, with both resulting in no further intersection in Euclidean space. However, it may be possible to construct some such polygons in spherical space, similarly to the monogon and digon; such polygons do not yet appear to have been studied in detail.\n\n\n== Simple isotoxal star polygons ==\nWhen the intersecting lines are removed, the star polygons are no longer regular, but can be seen as simple concave isotoxal 2n-gons, alternating vertices at two different radii, which do not necessarily have to match the regular star polygon angles. Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum in Tilings and Patterns represents these stars as |n/d| that match the geometry of polygram {n/d} with a notation {n\u03b1} more generally, representing an n-sided star with each internal angle \u03b1<180\u00b0(1-2/n) degrees. For |n/d|, the inner vertices have an exterior angle, \u03b2, as 360\u00b0(d-1)/n. \n\n\n=== Examples in tilings ===\n\nThese polygons are often seen in tiling patterns. The parametric angle \u03b1 (degrees or radians) can be chosen to match internal angles of neighboring polygons in a tessellation pattern. Johannes Kepler in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, including among other period tilings, nonperiodic tilings like that three regular pentagons, and a regular star pentagon (5.5.5.5/2) can fit around a vertex, and related to modern Penrose tilings.\n\n\n== Interiors ==\nThe interior of a star polygon may be treated in different ways. Three such treatments are illustrated for a pentagram. Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum and Geoffrey Shephard consider two of them, as regular star polygons and concave isogonal 2n-gons.\nThese include:\n\nWhere a side occurs, one side is treated as outside and the other as inside. This is shown in the left hand illustration and commonly occurs in computer vector graphics rendering.\nThe number of times that the polygonal curve winds around a given region determines its density. The exterior is given a density of 0, and any region of density > 0 is treated as internal. This is shown in the central illustration and commonly occurs in the mathematical treatment of polyhedra. (However, for non-orientable polyhedra density can only be considered modulo 2 and hence the first treatment is sometimes used instead in those cases for consistency.)\nWhere a line may be drawn between two sides, the region in which the line lies is treated as inside the figure. This is shown in the right hand illustration and commonly occurs when making a physical model.When the area of the polygon is calculated, each of these approaches yields a different answer.\n\n\n== In art and culture ==\n\nStar polygons feature prominently in art and culture. Such polygons may or may not be regular but they are always highly symmetrical. Examples include:\n\nThe {5/2} star pentagon (pentagram) is also known as a pentalpha or pentangle, and historically has been considered by many magical and religious cults to have occult significance.\nThe {7/2} and {7/3} star polygons (heptagrams) also have occult significance, particularly in the Kabbalah and in Wicca.\nThe {8/3} star polygon (octagram) is a frequent geometrical motif in Mughal Islamic art and architecture; the first is on the emblem of Azerbaijan.\nAn eleven pointed star called the hendecagram was used on the tomb of Shah Nemat Ollah Vali.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of regular polytopes and compounds#Stars\nFive-pointed star\nMagic star\nMoravian star\nPentagramma mirificum\nRegular star 4-polytope\nRub el Hizb\nStar (glyph)\nStar polyhedron, Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedron, and uniform star polyhedron\nStarfish\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCromwell, P.; Polyhedra, CUP, Hbk. 1997, ISBN 0-521-66432-2.

There are 2 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih3 and Dih1, and 3 cyclic group symmetries: Z9, Z3, and Z1.\nThese 6 symmetries can be seen in 6 distinct symmetries on the enneagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r18 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g9 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.\n\n\n== Tilings ==\nThe regular enneagon can tessellate the euclidean tiling with gaps. These gaps can be filled with regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. In the notation of symmetrohedron this tiling is called H(*;3;*;[2]) with H representing *632 hexagonal symmetry in the plane.\n\n\n== Graphs ==\nThe K9 complete graph is often drawn as a regular enneagon with all 36 edges connected. This graph also represents an orthographic projection of the 9 vertices and 36 edges of the 8-simplex.\n\n\n== Pop culture references ==\nThey Might Be Giants have a song entitled \"Nonagon\" on their children's album Here Come the 123s. It refers to both an attendee at a party at which \"everybody in the party is a many-sided polygon\" and a dance they perform at this party.\nSlipknot's logo is also a version of a nonagon, being a nine-pointed star made of three triangles, referring to the nine members.\nKing Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have an album titled 'Nonagon Infinity', the album art featuring a nonagonal complete graph.

The image of a figure by a reflection is its mirror image in the axis or plane of reflection. For example the mirror image of the small Latin letter p for a reflection with respect to a vertical axis would look like q. Its image by reflection in a horizontal axis would look like b. A reflection is an involution: when applied twice in succession, every point returns to its original location, and every geometrical object is restored to its original state.\nThe term reflection is sometimes used for a larger class of mappings from a Euclidean space to itself, namely the non-identity isometries that are involutions. Such isometries have a set of fixed points (the \"mirror\") that is an affine subspace, but is possibly smaller than a hyperplane. For instance a reflection through a point is an involutive isometry with just one fixed point; the image of the letter p under it\nwould look like a d. This operation is also known as a central inversion (Coxeter 1969, \u00a77.2), and exhibits Euclidean space as a symmetric space. In a Euclidean vector space, the reflection in the point situated at the origin is the same as vector negation. Other examples include reflections in a line in three-dimensional space. Typically, however, unqualified use of the term \"reflection\" means reflection in a hyperplane.\nSome mathematicians use \"flip\" as a synonym for \"reflection\".\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nIn a plane (or, respectively, 3-dimensional) geometry, to find the reflection of a point drop a perpendicular from the point to the line (plane) used for reflection, and extend it the same distance on the other side. To find the reflection of a figure, reflect each point in the figure.\nTo reflect point P through the line AB using compass and straightedge, proceed as follows (see figure):\n\nStep 1 (red): construct a circle with center at P and some fixed radius r to create points A\u2032 and B\u2032 on the line AB, which will be equidistant from P.\nStep 2 (green): construct circles centered at A\u2032 and B\u2032 having radius r. P and Q will be the points of intersection of these two circles.Point Q is then the reflection of point P through line AB.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe matrix for a reflection is orthogonal with determinant \u22121 and eigenvalues \u22121, 1, 1, ..., 1. The product of two such matrices is a special orthogonal matrix that represents a rotation. Every rotation is the result of reflecting in an even number of reflections in hyperplanes through the origin, and every improper rotation is the result of reflecting in an odd number. Thus reflections generate the orthogonal group, and this result is known as the Cartan\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 theorem.\nSimilarly the Euclidean group, which consists of all isometries of Euclidean space, is generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes.  In general, a group generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes is known as a reflection group. The finite groups generated in this way are examples of Coxeter groups.\n\n\n== Reflection across a line in the plane ==\n\nReflection across a line through the origin in two dimensions can be described by the following formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Ref\n          \n            l\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        v\n        )\n        =\n        2\n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              \u22c5\n              l\n            \n            \n              l\n              \u22c5\n              l\n            \n          \n        \n        l\n        \u2212\n        v\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Ref} _{l}(v)=2{\\frac {v\\cdot l}{l\\cdot l}}l-v,}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n   denotes the vector being reflected, \n  \n    \n      \n        l\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle l}\n   denotes any vector in the line across which the reflection is performed, and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        \u22c5\n        l\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v\\cdot l}\n   denotes the dot product of \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n   with \n  \n    \n      \n        l\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle l}\n  .

The square is therefore the shape of a topological ball according to the L1 distance metric.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe following animations show how to construct a square using a compass and straightedge. This is possible as 4 = 22, a power of two.\n\n\n== Symmetry ==\n\nThe square has Dih4 symmetry, order 8. There are 2 dihedral subgroups: Dih2, Dih1, and 3 cyclic subgroups: Z4, Z2, and Z1.\nA square is a special case of many lower symmetry quadrilaterals:\n\nA rectangle with two adjacent equal sides\nA quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles\nA parallelogram with one right angle and two adjacent equal sides\nA rhombus with a right angle\nA rhombus with all angles equal\nA rhombus with equal diagonalsThese 6 symmetries express 8 distinct symmetries on a square. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order.Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular quadrilaterals. r8 is full symmetry of the square, and a1 is no symmetry. d4 is the symmetry of a rectangle, and p4 is the symmetry of a rhombus. These two forms are duals of each other, and have half the symmetry order of the square. d2 is the symmetry of an isosceles trapezoid, and p2 is the symmetry of a kite. g2 defines the geometry of a parallelogram.\nOnly the g4 subgroup has no degrees of freedom, but can seen as a square with directed edges.\n\n\n== Squares inscribed in triangles ==\n\nEvery acute triangle has three inscribed squares (squares in its interior such that all four of a square's vertices lie on a side of the triangle, so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle). In a right triangle two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangle's right angle, so a right triangle has only two distinct inscribed squares. An obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle's longest side.\nThe fraction of the triangle's area that is filled by the square is no more than 1/2.\n\n\n== Squaring the circle ==\nSquaring the circle, proposed by ancient geometers, is the problem of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle, by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible as a consequence of the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi (\u03c0) is a transcendental number rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.\n\n\n== Non-Euclidean geometry ==\nIn non-Euclidean geometry, squares are more generally polygons with 4 equal sides and equal angles.\nIn spherical geometry, a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles. Unlike the square of plane geometry, the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle. Larger spherical squares have larger angles.\nIn hyperbolic geometry, squares with right angles do not exist. Rather, squares in hyperbolic geometry have angles of less than right angles. Larger hyperbolic squares have smaller angles.\nExamples:\n\n\n== Crossed square ==\n\nA crossed square is a faceting of the square, a self-intersecting polygon created by removing two opposite edges of a square and reconnecting by its two diagonals. It has half the symmetry of the square, Dih2, order 4. It has the same vertex arrangement as the square, and is vertex-transitive. It appears as two 45-45-90 triangle with a common vertex, but the geometric intersection is not considered a vertex.\nA crossed square is sometimes likened to a bow tie or butterfly. the crossed rectangle is related, as a faceting of the rectangle, both special cases of crossed quadrilaterals.The interior of a crossed square can have a polygon density of \u00b11 in each triangle, dependent upon the winding orientation as clockwise or counterclockwise.\nA square and a crossed square have the following properties in common:\n\nOpposite sides are equal in length.\nThe two diagonals are equal in length.\nIt has two lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180\u00b0).It exists in the vertex figure of a uniform star polyhedra, the tetrahemihexahedron.\n\n\n== Graphs ==\n\nThe K4 complete graph is often drawn as a square with all 6 possible edges connected, hence appearing as a square with both diagonals drawn. This graph also represents an orthographic projection of the 4 vertices and 6 edges of the regular 3-simplex (tetrahedron).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCube\nPythagorean theorem\nSquare lattice\nSquare number\nSquare root\nSquaring the square\nSquircle\nUnit square\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAnimated course (Construction, Circumference, Area)\nDefinition and properties of a square With interactive applet\nAnimated applet illustrating the area of a square", "Isosceles_triangle": "In geometry, an isosceles triangle () is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.\nExamples of isosceles triangles include the isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain Catalan solids.\nThe mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times, and appear frequently in architecture and design, for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings.\nThe two equal sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base of the triangle. The other dimensions of the triangle, such as its height, area, and perimeter, can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base.\nEvery isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along the perpendicular bisector of its base. The two angles opposite the legs are equal and are always acute, so the classification of the triangle as acute, right, or obtuse depends only on the angle between its two legs.\n\n\n== Terminology, classification, and examples ==\nEuclid defined an isosceles triangle as a triangle with exactly two equal sides, but modern treatments prefer to define isosceles triangles as having at least two equal sides. The difference between these two definitions is that the modern version makes equilateral triangles (with three equal sides) a special case of isosceles triangles. A triangle that is not isosceles (having three unequal sides) is called scalene.\n\"Isosceles\" is made from the Greek roots \"isos\" (equal) and \"skelos\" (leg). The same word is used, for instance, for isosceles trapezoids, trapezoids with two equal sides, and for isosceles sets, sets of points every three of which form an isosceles triangle.In an isosceles triangle that has exactly two equal sides, the equal sides are called legs and the third side is called the base. The angle included by the legs is called the vertex angle and the angles that have the base as one of their sides are called the base angles. The vertex opposite the base is called the apex. In the equilateral triangle case, since all sides are equal, any side can be called the base.\n\nWhether an isosceles triangle is acute, right or obtuse depends only on the angle at its apex. In Euclidean geometry, the base angles can not be obtuse (greater than 90\u00b0) or right (equal to 90\u00b0) because their measures would sum to at least 180\u00b0, the total of all angles in any Euclidean triangle. Since a triangle is obtuse or right if and only if one of its angles is obtuse or right, respectively, an isosceles triangle is obtuse, right or acute if and only if its apex angle is respectively obtuse, right or acute. In Edwin Abbott's book Flatland, this classification of shapes was used as a satire of social hierarchy: isosceles triangles represented the working class, with acute isosceles triangles higher in the hierarchy than right or obtuse isosceles triangles.As well as the isosceles right triangle, several other specific shapes of isosceles triangles have been studied.\nThese include the Calabi triangle (a triangle with three congruent inscribed squares), the golden triangle and golden gnomon (two isosceles triangles whose sides and base are in the golden ratio), the 80-80-20 triangle appearing in the Langley's Adventitious Angles puzzle, and the 30-30-120 triangle of the triakis triangular tiling.\nFive Catalan solids, the triakis tetrahedron, triakis octahedron, tetrakis hexahedron, pentakis dodecahedron, and triakis icosahedron, each have isosceles-triangle faces, as do infinitely many pyramids and bipyramids.\n\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n\n=== Height ===\nFor any isosceles triangle, the following six line segments coincide:\n\nthe altitude, a line segment from the apex perpendicular to the base,\nthe angle bisector from the apex to the base,\nthe median from the apex to the midpoint of the base,\nthe perpendicular bisector of the base within the triangle,\nthe segment within the triangle of the unique axis of symmetry of the triangle, and\nthe segment within the triangle of the Euler line of the triangle, except when the triangle is equilateral.Their common length is the height \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   of the triangle.\nIf the triangle has equal sides of length \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   and base of length \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  ,\nthe general triangle formulas for \nthe lengths of these segments all simplify to\n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                4\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h={\\sqrt {a^{2}-{\\frac {b^{2}}{4}}}}.}\n  This formula can also be derived from the Pythagorean theorem using the fact that the altitude bisects the base and partitions the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles.The Euler line of any triangle goes through the triangle's orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes), its centroid (the intersection of its three  medians), and its circumcenter (the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of its three sides, which is also the center of the circumcircle that passes through the three vertices). In an isosceles triangle with exactly two equal sides, these three points are distinct, and (by symmetry) all lie on the symmetry axis of the triangle, from which it follows that the Euler line coincides with the axis of symmetry. The incenter of the triangle also lies on the Euler line, something that is not true for other triangles. If any two of an angle bisector, median, or altitude coincide in a given triangle, that triangle must be isosceles.\n\n\n=== Area ===\nThe area \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n   of an isosceles triangle can be derived from the formula for its height, and from the general formula for the area of a triangle as half the product of base and height:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        =\n        \n          \n            b\n            4\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            4\n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T={\\frac {b}{4}}{\\sqrt {4a^{2}-b^{2}}}.}\n  The same area formula can also be derived from Heron's formula for the area of a triangle from its three sides. However, applying Heron's formula directly can be numerically unstable for isosceles triangles with very sharp angles, because of the near-cancellation between the semiperimeter and side length in those triangles.If the apex angle \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\theta )}\n   and leg lengths \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        a\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (a)}\n   of an isosceles triangle are known, then the area of that triangle is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T={\\frac {1}{2}}a^{2}\\sin \\theta .}\n  This is a special case of the general formula for the area of a triangle as half the product of two sides times the sine of the included angle.\n\n\n=== Perimeter ===\nThe perimeter \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n   of an isosceles triangle with equal sides \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   and base \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   is just\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        2\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p=2a+b.}\n  As in any triangle, the area \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n   and perimeter \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n   are related by the isoperimetric inequality\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        >\n        12\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        T\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p^{2}>12{\\sqrt {3}}T.}\n  This is a strict inequality for isosceles triangles with sides unequal to the base, and becomes an equality for the equilateral triangle.\nThe area, perimeter, and base can also be related to each other by the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        p\n        \n          b\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          p\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        16\n        \n          T\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2pb^{3}-p^{2}b^{2}+16T^{2}=0.}\n  If the base and perimeter are fixed, then this formula determines the area of the resulting isosceles triangle, which is the maximum possible among all triangles with the same base and perimeter.\nOn the other hand, if the area and perimeter are fixed, this formula can be used to recover the base length, but not uniquely: there are in general two distinct isosceles triangles with given area \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n   and perimeter \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  .

It was formulated in 1840 by C. L. Lehmus. Its other namesake, Jakob Steiner, was one of the first to provide a solution.\nAlthough originally formulated only for internal angle bisectors, it works for many (but not all) cases when, instead, two external angle bisectors are equal.\nThe 30-30-120 isosceles triangle makes a boundary case for this variation of the theorem, as it has four equal angle bisectors (two internal, two external).\n\n\n=== Radii ===\n\nThe inradius and circumradius formulas for an isosceles triangle may be derived from their formulas for arbitrary triangles.\nThe radius of the inscribed circle of an isosceles triangle with side length \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  , base \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  , and height \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              a\n              b\n              \u2212\n              \n                b\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              4\n              h\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2ab-b^{2}}{4h}}.}\n  The center of the circle lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle, this distance above the base.\nAn isosceles triangle has the largest possible inscribed circle among the triangles with the same base and apex angle, as well as also having the largest area and perimeter among the same class of triangles.The radius of the circumscribed circle is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              2\n              h\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {a^{2}}{2h}}.}\n  The center of the circle lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle, this distance below the apex.\n\n\n=== Inscribed square ===\nFor any isosceles triangle, there is a unique square with one side collinear with the base of the triangle and the opposite two corners on its sides. The Calabi triangle is a special isosceles triangle with the property that the other two inscribed squares, with sides collinear with the sides of the triangle,\nare of the same size as the base square.

This is because the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the center of the circumcircle of the right triangle, and each of the two triangles created by the partition has two equal radii as two of its sides.\nSimilarly, an acute triangle can be partitioned into three isosceles triangles by segments from its circumcenter, but this method does not work for obtuse triangles, because the circumcenter lies outside the triangle.Generalizing the partition of an acute triangle, any cyclic polygon that contains the center of its circumscribed circle can be partitioned into isosceles triangles by the radii of this circle through its vertices. The fact that all radii of a circle have equal length implies that all of these triangles are isosceles. This partition can be used to derive a formula for the area of the polygon as a function of its side lengths, even for cyclic polygons that do not contain their circumcenters. This formula generalizes Heron's formula for triangles and Brahmagupta's formula for cyclic quadrilaterals.Either diagonal of a rhombus divides it into two congruent isosceles triangles. Similarly, one of the two diagonals of\na kite divides it into two isosceles triangles, which are not congruent except when the kite is a rhombus.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== In architecture and design ===\n\nIsosceles triangles commonly appear in architecture as the shapes of gables and pediments. In ancient Greek architecture and its later imitations, the obtuse isosceles triangle was used; in Gothic architecture this was replaced by the acute isosceles triangle.In the architecture of the Middle Ages, another isosceles triangle shape became popular: the Egyptian isosceles triangle. This is an isosceles triangle that is acute, but less so than the equilateral triangle; its height is proportional to 5/8 of its base. The Egyptian isosceles triangle was brought back into use in modern architecture by Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage.\n\nWarren truss structures, such as bridges, are commonly arranged in isosceles triangles, although sometimes vertical beams are also included for additional strength.\nSurfaces tessellated by obtuse isosceles triangles can be used to form deployable structures that have two stable states: an unfolded state in which the surface expands to a cylindrical column, and a folded state in which it folds into a more compact prism shape that can be more easily transported. The same tessellation pattern forms the basis of Yoshimura buckling, a pattern formed when cylindrical surfaces are axially compressed, and of the Schwarz lantern, an example used in mathematics to show that the area of a smooth surface cannot always be accurately approximated by polyhedra converging to the surface.\n\nIn graphic design and the decorative arts, isosceles triangles have been a frequent design element in cultures around the world from at least the Early Neolithic to modern times. They are a common design element in flags and heraldry, appearing prominently with a vertical base, for instance, in the flag of Guyana, or with a horizontal base in the flag of Saint Lucia, where they form a stylized image of a mountain island.They also have been used in designs with religious or mystic significance, for instance in the Sri Yantra of Hindu meditational practice.\n\n\n=== In other areas of mathematics ===\nIf a cubic equation with real coefficients has three roots that are not all real numbers, then when these roots are plotted in the complex plane as an Argand diagram they form vertices of an isosceles triangle whose axis of symmetry coincides with the horizontal (real) axis. This is because the complex roots are complex conjugates and hence are symmetric about the real axis.In celestial mechanics, the three-body problem has been studied in the special case that the three bodies form an isosceles triangle, because assuming that the bodies are arranged in this way reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the system without reducing it to the solved Lagrangian point case when the bodies form an equilateral triangle. The first instances of the three-body problem shown to have unbounded oscillations were in the isosceles three-body problem.\n\n\n== History and fallacies ==\nLong before isosceles triangles were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians, the practitioners of Ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics knew how to calculate their area. Problems of this type are included in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.The theorem that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal appears as Proposition I.5 in Euclid. This result has been called the pons asinorum (the bridge of asses) or the isosceles triangle theorem. Rival explanations for this name include the theory that it is because the diagram used by Euclid in his demonstration of the result resembles a bridge, or because this is the first difficult result in Euclid, and acts to separate those who can understand Euclid's geometry from those who cannot.A well-known fallacy is the false proof of the statement that all triangles are isosceles. Robin Wilson credits this argument to Lewis Carroll, who published it in 1899, but W. W. Rouse Ball published it in 1892 and later wrote that Carroll obtained the argument from him. The fallacy is rooted in Euclid's lack of recognition of the concept of betweenness and the resulting ambiguity of inside versus outside of figures.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W., \"Isosceles triangle\", MathWorld", "Face_(geometry)": "In solid geometry, a face is a flat surface (a planar region) that forms part of the boundary of a solid object; a three-dimensional solid bounded exclusively by faces is a polyhedron.\nIn more technical treatments of the geometry of polyhedra and higher-dimensional polytopes, the term is also used to mean an element of any dimension of a more general polytope (in any number of dimensions).\n\n\n== Polygonal face ==\nIn elementary geometry, a face is a polygon on the boundary of a polyhedron. Other names for a polygonal face include polyhedron side and Euclidean plane tile.\nFor example, any of the six squares that bound a cube is a face of the cube. Sometimes \"face\" is also used to refer to the 2-dimensional features of a 4-polytope. With this meaning, the 4-dimensional tesseract has 24 square faces, each sharing two of 8 cubic cells.\n\n\n=== Number of polygonal faces of a polyhedron ===\nAny convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        \u2212\n        E\n        +\n        F\n        =\n        2\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V-E+F=2,}\n  where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula. Thus the number of faces is 2 more than the excess of the number of edges over the number of vertices. For example, a cube has 12 edges and 8 vertices, and hence 6 faces.\n\n\n== k-face ==\nIn higher-dimensional geometry, the faces of a polytope are features of all dimensions. A face of dimension k is called a k-face. For example, the polygonal faces of an ordinary polyhedron are 2-faces. In set theory, the set of faces of a polytope includes the polytope itself and the empty set, where the empty set is for consistency given a \"dimension\" of \u22121. For any n-polytope (n-dimensional polytope), \u22121 \u2264 k \u2264 n.\nFor example, with this meaning, the faces of a cube comprise the cube itself (3-face), its (square) facets (2-faces), (linear) edges (1-faces), (point) vertices (0-faces), and the empty set. The following are the faces of a 4-dimensional polytope:\n\n4-face \u2013 the 4-dimensional 4-polytope itself\n3-faces \u2013 3-dimensional cells (polyhedral faces)\n2-faces \u2013 2-dimensional ridges (polygonal faces)\n1-faces \u2013 1-dimensional edges\n0-faces \u2013 0-dimensional vertices\nthe empty set, which has dimension \u22121In some areas of mathematics, such as polyhedral combinatorics, a polytope is by definition convex. Formally, a face of a polytope P is the intersection of P with any closed halfspace whose boundary is disjoint from the interior of P. From this definition it follows that the set of faces of a polytope includes the polytope itself and the empty set.In other areas of mathematics, such as the theories of abstract polytopes and star polytopes, the requirement for convexity is relaxed. Abstract theory still requires that the set of faces include the polytope itself and the empty set.\n\n\n=== Cell or 3-face ===\nA cell is a polyhedral element (3-face) of a 4-dimensional polytope or 3-dimensional tessellation, or higher. Cells are facets for 4-polytopes and 3-honeycombs.\nExamples:\n\n\n=== Facet or (n \u2212 1)-face ===\nIn higher-dimensional geometry, the facets (also called hyperfaces) of a n-polytope are the (n-1)-faces (faces of dimension one less than the polytope itself). A polytope is bounded by its facets.\nFor example:\n\nThe facets of a line segment are its 0-faces or vertices.\nThe facets of a polygon are its 1-faces or edges.\nThe facets of a polyhedron or plane tiling are its 2-faces.\nThe facets of a 4D polytope or 3-honeycomb are its 3-faces or cells.\nThe facets of a 5D polytope or 4-honeycomb are its 4-faces.\n\n\n=== Ridge or (n \u2212 2)-face ===\nIn related terminology, the (n \u2212 2)-faces of an n-polytope are called ridges (also subfacets). A ridge is seen as the boundary between exactly two facets of a polytope or honeycomb.\nFor example:\n\nThe ridges of a 2D polygon or 1D tiling are its 0-faces or vertices.\nThe ridges of a 3D polyhedron or plane tiling are its 1-faces or edges.\nThe ridges of a 4D polytope or 3-honeycomb are its 2-faces or simply faces.\nThe ridges of a 5D polytope or 4-honeycomb are its 3-faces or cells.\n\n\n=== Peak or (n \u2212 3)-face ===\nThe (n \u2212 3)-faces of an n-polytope are called peaks. A peak contains a rotational axis of facets and ridges in a regular polytope or honeycomb.\nFor example:\n\nThe peaks of a 3D polyhedron or plane tiling are its 0-faces or vertices.\nThe peaks of a 4D polytope or 3-honeycomb are its 1-faces or edges.\nThe peaks of a 5D polytope or 4-honeycomb are its 2-faces or simply faces.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFace lattice\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Face\". MathWorld.\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Facet\". MathWorld.\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Side\". MathWorld.", "Arc_(geometry)": "In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight.\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: \"The [curved] line is [\u2026] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which [\u2026] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\"This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve.\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nInterest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study.  This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric\ntimes. Curves, or at least their graphical representations, are simple to create, for example with a stick on the sand on a beach.\nHistorically, the term line was used in place of the more modern term curve. Hence the terms straight line and right line were used to distinguish what are today called lines from curved lines. For example, in Book I of Euclid's Elements, a line is defined as a \"breadthless length\" (Def. 2), while a straight line is defined as \"a line that lies evenly with the points on itself\" (Def. 4). Euclid's idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement \"The extremities of a line are points,\" (Def. 3). Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes. For example:\nComposite lines (lines forming an angle)\nIncomposite lines\nDeterminate (lines that do not extend indefinitely, such as the circle)\nIndeterminate (lines that extend indefinitely, such as the straight line and the parabola)\nThe Greek geometers had studied many other kinds of curves. One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard compass and straightedge construction.\nThese curves include:\n\nThe conic sections, studied in depth by Apollonius of Perga\nThe cissoid of Diocles, studied by Diocles and used as a method to double the cube.\nThe conchoid of Nicomedes, studied by Nicomedes as a method to both double the cube and to trisect an angle.\nThe Archimedean spiral, studied by Archimedes as a method to trisect an angle and square the circle.\nThe spiric sections, sections of tori studied by Perseus as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius.\nA fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the introduction of analytic geometry by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the seventeenth century. This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction. This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied, but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between algebraic curves that can be defined using polynomial equations, and transcendental curves that cannot. Previously, curves had been described as \"geometrical\" or \"mechanical\" according to how they were, or supposedly could be, generated.Conic sections were applied in astronomy by Kepler.\nNewton also worked on an early example in the calculus of variations. Solutions to variational problems, such as the brachistochrone and tautochrone questions, introduced properties of curves in new ways (in this case, the cycloid). The catenary gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain, the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of differential calculus.\nIn the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves, in general. Newton had studied the cubic curves, in the general description of the real points into 'ovals'. The statement of B\u00e9zout's theorem showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time, to do with singular points and complex solutions.\nSince the nineteenth century, curve theory is viewed as the special case of dimension one of the theory of manifolds and algebraic varieties. Nevertheless, many questions remain specific to curves, such as space-filling curves, Jordan curve theorem and Hilbert's sixteenth problem.\n\n\n== Topological curve ==\nA topological curve can be specified by a continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        :\n        I\n        \u2192\n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma \\colon I\\rightarrow X}\n   from an interval I of the real numbers into a topological space X. Properly speaking, the curve is the image of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma .}\n   However, in some contexts, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   itself is called a curve, especially when the image does not look like what is generally called a curve and does not characterize sufficiently \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma .}\n  \nFor example, the image of the Peano curve or, more generally, a space-filling curve completely fills a square, and therefore does not give any information on how \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   is defined.\nA curve \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   is closed or is a loop if \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        [\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I=[a,b]}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        \u03b3\n        (\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma (a)=\\gamma (b)}\n  .  A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of a circle.\nIf the domain of a topological curve is a closed and bounded interval \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        [\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I=[a,b]}\n  , the curve is called a path, also known as topological arc (or just arc).\nA curve is simple if it is the image of an interval or a circle by an injective continuous function. In other words, if a curve is defined by a continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n   with an interval as a domain, the curve is simple if and only if any two different points of the interval have different images, except, possibly, if the points are the endpoints of the interval. Intuitively, a simple curve is a curve that \"does not cross itself and has no missing points\" (a continuous non-self-intersecting curve).A plane curve is a curve for which \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   is the Euclidean plane\u2014these are the examples first encountered\u2014or in some cases the projective plane. A space curve is a curve for which \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   is at least three-dimensional; a skew curve  is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to real algebraic curves, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be disconnected).\n\nA plane simple closed curve is also called a Jordan curve. It is also defined as a non-self-intersecting continuous loop in the plane. The Jordan curve theorem states that the set complement in a plane of a Jordan curve consists of two connected components (that is the curve divides the plane in two non-intersecting regions that are both connected).\nThe definition of a curve  includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage. For example, the image of a simple curve can cover a square in the plane (space-filling curve) and thus have a positive area. Fractal curves can have properties that are strange for the common sense. For example, a  fractal curve can have a Hausdorff dimension bigger than one (see Koch snowflake) and even a positive area. An example is the dragon curve, which has many other unusual properties.\n\n\n== Differentiable curve ==\n\nRoughly speaking a differentiable curve is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective differentiable function \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        :\n        I\n        \u2192\n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma \\colon I\\rightarrow X}\n   from an interval I of the real numbers into a differentiable manifold X, often \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}.}\n  \nMore precisely, a differentiable curve is a subset C of X where every point of C has a neighborhood U such that \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        \u2229\n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C\\cap U}\n   is diffeomorphic to an interval of the real numbers. In other words, a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one.\n\n\n=== Differentiable arc ===\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, an arc (symbol: \u2312) is a connected subset of a differentiable curve. \nArcs of lines are called segments, rays, or lines, depending on how they are bounded.\nA common curved example is an arc of a circle, called a circular arc. \nIn a sphere (or a spheroid), an arc of a great circle (or a great ellipse) is called a great arc.\n\n\n=== Length of a curve ===\n\nIf \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        =\n        \n          \n            R\n

The needs of geometry, and also for example classical mechanics are to have a notion of curve in space of any number of dimensions. In general relativity, a world line is a curve in spacetime.\nIf \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   is a differentiable manifold, then we can define the notion of differentiable curve in \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  . This general idea is enough to cover many of the applications of curves in mathematics. From a local point of view one can take \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   to be Euclidean space.

A plane algebraic curve is the set of the points of coordinates x, y such that f(x, y) = 0, where f is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field F. One says that the curve is defined over F. Algebraic geometry normally considers not only points with coordinates in F but all the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field K. \nIf C is a curve defined by a polynomial f with coefficients in F, the curve is said to be defined over F. \nIn the case of a curve defined over the real numbers, one normally considers points with complex coordinates. In this case, a point with real coordinates is a real point, and the set of all real points is the real part of the curve. It is therefore only the real part of an algebraic curve that can be a topological curve (this is not always the case, as the real part of an algebraic curve may be disconnected and contain isolated points). The whole curve, that is the set of its complex point is, from the topological point of view a surface. In particular, the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called Riemann surfaces.\nThe points of a curve C with coordinates in a field G are said to be rational over G and can be denoted C(G). When G is the field of the rational numbers, one simply talks of rational points. For example, Fermat's Last Theorem may be restated as: For n > 2, every rational point of the Fermat curve of degree n has a zero coordinate.\nAlgebraic curves can also be space curves, or curves in a space of higher dimension, say n. They are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one. They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least n\u20131 polynomial equations in n variables. If n\u20131 polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension n, the curve is said to be a complete intersection. By eliminating variables (by any tool of elimination theory), an algebraic curve may be projected onto a plane algebraic curve, which however may introduce new singularities such as cusps or double points.\nA plane curve may also be completed to a curve in the projective plane: if a curve is defined by a polynomial f of total degree d, then wdf(u/w, v/w) simplifies to a homogeneous polynomial g(u, v, w) of degree d. The values of u, v, w such that g(u, v, w) = 0 are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such that w is not zero. An example is the Fermat curve un + vn = wn, which has an affine form xn + yn = 1. A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces.\nExcept for lines, the simplest examples of algebraic curves are the conics, which are nonsingular curves of degree two and genus zero. Elliptic curves, which are nonsingular curves of genus one, are studied in number theory, and have important applications to cryptography.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nA.S.

This means that either object can be repositioned and reflected (but not resized) so as to coincide precisely with the other object. Therefore two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if they can be cut out and then matched up completely. Turning the paper over is permitted.\n\nIn elementary geometry the word congruent is often used as follows.  The word equal is often used in place of congruent for these objects.\n\nTwo line segments are congruent if they have the same length.\nTwo angles are congruent if they have the same measure.\nTwo circles are congruent if they have the same diameter.In this sense, two plane figures are congruent implies that their corresponding characteristics are \"congruent\" or \"equal\" including not just their corresponding sides and angles, but also their corresponding diagonals, perimeters, and areas.\nThe related concept of similarity applies if the objects have the same shape but do not necessarily have the same size. (Most definitions consider congruence to be a form of similarity, although a minority require that the objects have different sizes in order to qualify as similar.)\n\n\n== Determining congruence of polygons ==\n\nFor two polygons to be congruent, they must have an equal number of sides (and hence an equal number\u2014the same number\u2014of vertices). Two polygons with n sides are congruent if and only if they each have numerically identical sequences (even if clockwise for one polygon and counterclockwise for the other) side-angle-side-angle-... for n sides and n angles.\nCongruence of polygons can be established graphically as follows:\n\nFirst, match and label the corresponding vertices of the two figures.\nSecond, draw a vector from one of the vertices of the one of the figures to the corresponding vertex of the other figure. Translate the first figure by this vector so that these two vertices match.\nThird, rotate the translated figure about the matched vertex until one pair of corresponding sides matches.\nFourth, reflect the rotated figure about this matched side until the figures match.If at any time the step cannot be completed, the polygons are not congruent.\n\n\n== Congruence of triangles ==\n\nTwo triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal in length, and their corresponding angles are equal in measure.\nSymbolically, we write the congruency and incongruency of two triangles \u25b3ABC and \u25b3A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032 as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        \u2245\n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          B\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          C\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABC\\cong A'B'C'}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        \u2246\n        \n          A\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          B\n          \u2032\n        \n        \n          C\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABC\\ncong A'B'C'}\n  In many cases it is sufficient to establish the equality of three corresponding parts and use one of the following results to deduce the congruence of the two triangles.\n\n\n=== Determining congruence ===\nSufficient evidence for congruence between two triangles in Euclidean space can be shown through the following comparisons:\n\nSAS (side-angle-side): If two pairs of sides of two triangles are equal in length, and the included angles are equal in measurement, then the triangles are congruent.\nSSS (side-side-side): If three pairs of sides of two triangles are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.\nASA (angle-side-angle): If two pairs of angles of two triangles are equal in measurement, and the included sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.The ASA postulate was contributed by Thales of Miletus (Greek). In most systems of axioms, the three criteria \u2013 SAS, SSS and ASA \u2013 are established as theorems. In the School Mathematics Study Group system SAS is taken as one (#15) of 22 postulates.\n\nAAS (angle-angle-side): If two pairs of angles of two triangles are equal in measurement, and a pair of corresponding non-included sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent. AAS is equivalent to an ASA condition, by the fact that if any two angles are given, so is the third angle, since their sum should be 180\u00b0. ASA and AAS are sometimes combined into a single condition, AAcorrS \u2013 any two angles and a corresponding side.\nRHS (right-angle-hypotenuse-side), also known as  HL (hypotenuse-leg): If two right-angled triangles have their hypotenuses equal in length, and a pair of other sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n\n==== Side-side-angle ====\nThe SSA condition (side-side-angle) which specifies two sides and a non-included angle (also known as ASS, or angle-side-side) does not by itself prove congruence. In order to show congruence, additional information is required such as the measure of the corresponding angles and in some cases the lengths of the two pairs of corresponding sides. There are a few possible cases:\nIf two triangles satisfy the SSA condition and the length of the side opposite the angle is greater than or equal to the length of the adjacent side (SSA, or long side-short side-angle), then the two triangles are congruent. The opposite side is sometimes longer when the corresponding angles are acute, but it is always longer when the corresponding angles are right or obtuse. Where the angle is a right angle, also known as the hypotenuse-leg (HL) postulate or the right-angle-hypotenuse-side (RHS) condition, the third side can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem thus allowing the SSS postulate to be applied.\nIf two triangles satisfy the SSA condition and the corresponding angles are acute and the length of the side opposite the angle is equal to the length of the adjacent side multiplied by the sine of the angle, then the two triangles are congruent.\nIf two triangles satisfy the SSA condition and the corresponding angles are acute and the length of the side opposite the angle is greater than the length of the adjacent side multiplied by the sine of the angle (but less than the length of the adjacent side), then the two triangles cannot be shown to be congruent. This is the ambiguous case and two different triangles can be formed from the given information, but further information distinguishing them can lead to a proof of congruence.\n\n\n==== Angle-angle-angle ====\nIn Euclidean geometry, AAA (angle-angle-angle) (or just AA, since in Euclidean geometry the angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0) does not provide information regarding the size of the two triangles and hence proves only similarity and not congruence in Euclidean space.\nHowever, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry (where the sum of the angles of a triangle varies with size) AAA is sufficient for congruence on a given curvature of surface.\n\n\n=== CPCTC ===\nThis acronym stands for Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent, which is an abbreviated version of the definition of congruent triangles.In more detail, it is a succinct way to say that if triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, that is,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u25b3\n        A\n        B\n        C\n        \u2245\n        \u25b3\n        D\n        E\n        F\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\triangle ABC\\cong \\triangle DEF,}\n  with corresponding pairs of angles at vertices A and D; B and E; and C and F, and with corresponding pairs of sides AB and DE; BC and EF; and CA and FD, then the following statements are true:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              B\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n        \u2245\n        \n          \n            \n              D\n              E\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overline {AB}}\\cong {\\overline {DE}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              B\n              C\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n        \u2245\n        \n          \n            \n              E\n              F\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overline {BC}}\\cong {\\overline {EF}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              C\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n        \u2245\n        \n          \n            \n              D\n              F\n            \n            \u00af\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overline {AC}}\\cong {\\overline {DF}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2220\n        B\n        A\n        C\n        \u2245\n        \u2220\n        E\n        D\n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle BAC\\cong \\angle EDF}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2220\n        A\n        B\n        C\n        \u2245\n        \u2220\n        D\n        E\n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle ABC\\cong \\angle DEF}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2220\n        B\n        C\n        A\n        \u2245\n        \u2220\n        E\n        F\n        D\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle BCA\\cong \\angle EFD.}\n  The statement is often used as a justification in elementary geometry proofs when a conclusion of the congruence of parts of two triangles is needed after the congruence of the triangles has been established. For example, if two triangles have been shown to be congruent by the SSS criteria and a statement that corresponding angles are congruent is needed in a proof, then CPCTC may be used as a justification of this statement.\nA related theorem is CPCFC, in which \"triangles\" is replaced with \"figures\" so that the theorem applies to any pair of polygons or polyhedrons that are congruent.\n\n\n== Definition of congruence in analytic geometry ==\nIn a Euclidean system, congruence is fundamental; it is the counterpart of equality for numbers.  In analytic geometry, congruence may be defined intuitively thus: two mappings of figures onto one Cartesian coordinate system are congruent if and only if, for any two points in the first mapping, the Euclidean distance between them is equal to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points in the second mapping.\nA more formal definition states that two subsets A and B of Euclidean space Rn are called congruent if there exists an isometry f : Rn  \u2192 Rn (an element of the Euclidean group E(n)) with f(A) = B. Congruence is an equivalence relation.\n\n\n== Congruent conic sections ==\nTwo conic sections are congruent if their eccentricities and one other distinct parameter characterizing them are equal. Their eccentricities establish their shapes, equality of which is sufficient to establish similarity, and the second parameter then establishes size. Since two circles, parabolas, or rectangular hyperbolas always have the same eccentricity (specifically 0 in the case of circles, 1 in the case of parabolas, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n   in the case of rectangular hyperbolas), two circles, parabolas, or rectangular hyperbolas need to have only one other common parameter value, establishing their size, for them to be congruent.\n\n\n== Congruent polyhedra ==\nFor two polyhedra with the same combinatorial type (that is, the same \nnumber E of edges, the same number of faces, and the same number of sides on corresponding faces), there exists a set of E measurements that can establish whether or not the polyhedra are congruent.\nThe number is tight, meaning that less than E measurements are not enough if the polyhedra are generic among their combinatorial type. But less measurements can work for special cases. For example, cubes have 12 edges, but 9 measurements are enough to decide if a polyhedron of that combinatorial type is congruent to a given regular cube.\n\n\n== Congruent triangles on a sphere ==\n\nAs with plane triangles, on a sphere two triangles sharing the same sequence of angle-side-angle (ASA) are necessarily congruent (that is, they have three identical sides and three identical angles). This can be seen as follows: One can situate one of the vertices with a given angle at the south pole and run the side with given length up the prime meridian. Knowing both angles at either end of the segment of fixed length ensures that the other two sides emanate with a uniquely determined trajectory, and thus will meet each other at a uniquely determined point; thus ASA is valid.\nThe congruence theorems side-angle-side (SAS) and side-side-side (SSS) also hold on a sphere; in addition, if two spherical triangles have an identical angle-angle-angle (AAA) sequence, they are congruent (unlike for plane triangles).The plane-triangle congruence theorem angle-angle-side (AAS) does not hold for spherical triangles. As in plane geometry, side-side-angle (SSA) does not imply congruence.\n\n\n== Notation ==\nA symbol commonly used for congruence is an equals symbol with a tilde above it, \u2245, corresponding to the Unicode character 'approximately equal to' (U+2245).  In the UK, the three-bar equal sign \u2261 (U+2261) is sometimes used.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEuclidean plane isometry\nIsometry\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe SSS at Cut-the-Knot\nThe SSA at Cut-the-Knot\nInteractive animations demonstrating Congruent polygons, Congruent angles, Congruent line segments, Congruent triangles at Math Open Reference", "Exterior_angle_theorem": "The exterior angle theorem is Proposition 1.16 in Euclid's Elements, which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the measures of the remote interior angles. This is a fundamental result in absolute geometry because its proof does not depend upon the parallel postulate.\nIn several high school treatments of geometry, the term \"exterior angle theorem\" has been applied to a different result, namely the portion of Proposition 1.32 which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the remote interior angles. This result, which depends upon Euclid's parallel postulate will be referred to as the \"High school exterior angle theorem\" (HSEAT) to distinguish it from Euclid's exterior angle theorem.\nSome authors refer to the \"High school exterior angle theorem\" as the strong form of the exterior angle theorem and \"Euclid's exterior angle theorem\" as the weak form.\n\n\n== Exterior angles ==\nA triangle has three corners, called vertices. The sides of a triangle (line segments) that come together at a vertex form two angles (four angles if you consider the sides of the triangle to be lines instead of line segments). Only one of these angles contains the third side of the triangle in its interior, and this angle is called an interior angle of the triangle. In the picture below, the angles  \u2220ABC, \u2220BCA and \u2220CAB are the three interior angles of the triangle. An exterior angle is formed by extending one of the sides of the triangle; the angle between the extended side and the other side is the exterior angle. In the picture, angle \u2220ACD is an exterior angle. \n\n\n== Euclid's exterior angle theorem ==\nThe proof of Proposition 1.16  given by Euclid is often cited as one place where Euclid gives a flawed proof.Euclid proves the exterior angle theorem by:\n\nconstruct the midpoint E of segment AC,\ndraw the ray BE,\nconstruct the point F on ray BE so that E is (also) the midpoint of B and F,\ndraw the segment FC.By congruent triangles we can conclude that \u2220 BAC = \u2220 ECF and \u2220 ECF is smaller than \u2220 ECD, \u2220 ECD = \u2220 ACD therefore \u2220 BAC is smaller than \u2220 ACD and the same can be done for the angle  \u2220 CBA by bisecting BC.\nThe flaw lies in the assumption that a point (F, above) lies \"inside\" angle (\u2220 ACD). No reason is given for this assertion, but the accompanying diagram makes it look like a true statement. When a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry is used (see Foundations of geometry) this assertion of Euclid can be proved.\n\n\n=== Invalidity in spherical geometry ===\n\nThe exterior angle theorem is not valid in spherical geometry nor in the related elliptical geometry. Consider a spherical triangle one of whose vertices is the North Pole and the other two lie on the equator. The sides of the triangle emanating from the North Pole (great circles of the sphere) both meet the equator at right angles, so this triangle has an exterior angle that is equal to a remote interior angle. The other interior angle (at the North Pole) can be made larger than 90\u00b0, further emphasizing the failure of this statement. However, since the Euclid's exterior angle theorem is a theorem in absolute geometry it is automatically valid in hyperbolic geometry.\n\n\n== High school exterior angle theorem ==\nThe high school exterior angle theorem (HSEAT) says that the size of an exterior angle at a vertex of a triangle equals the sum of the sizes of the interior angles at the other two vertices of the triangle (remote interior angles). So, in the picture, the size of angle ACD equals the size of angle ABC plus the size of angle CAB.\nThe HSEAT is logically equivalent to the Euclidean statement that the sum of angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0. If it is known that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0, then the HSEAT is proved as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        +\n        d\n        =\n        \n          180\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b+d=180^{\\circ }}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        +\n        d\n        =\n        b\n        +\n        a\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b+d=b+a+c}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2234\n        d\n        =\n        a\n        +\n        c\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\therefore d=a+c.}\n  On the other hand, if the HSEAT is taken as a true statement then:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        =\n        a\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d=a+c}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        +\n        d\n        =\n        \n          180\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b+d=180^{\\circ }}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2234\n        b\n        +\n        a\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        \n          180\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\therefore b+a+c=180^{\\circ }.}\n  \nProving that the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0.\nThe Euclidean proof of the HSEAT (and simultaneously the result on the sum of the angles of a triangle) starts by constructing the line parallel to side AB passing through point C and then using the properties of corresponding angles and alternate interior angles of parallel lines to get the conclusion as in the illustration.The HSEAT can be extremely useful when trying to calculate the measures of unknown angles in a triangle.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFaber, Richard L.

All cross-sections parallel to the bases are translations of the bases. Prisms are named after their bases, e.g. a prism with a pentagonal base is called a pentagonal prism. Prisms are a subclass of prismatoids.\nLike many basic geometric terms, the word prism (from Greek  \u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 (prisma) 'something sawed') was first used in Euclid's Elements. Euclid defined the term in Book XI as \u201ca solid figure contained by two opposite, equal and parallel planes, while the rest are parallelograms\u201d. However, this definition has been criticized for not being specific enough in relation to the nature of the bases, which caused confusion among later geometry writers.\n\n\n== Oblique vs right ==\nAn oblique prism is a prism in which the joining edges and faces are not perpendicular to the base faces.\nExample: a parallelepiped is an oblique prism whose base is a parallelogram, or equivalently a polyhedron with six parallelogram faces.\n\nA right prism is a prism in which the joining edges and faces are perpendicular to the base faces. This applies if and only if all the joining faces are rectangular.\nThe dual of a right n-prism is a right n-bipyramid.\nA right prism (with rectangular sides) with regular n-gon bases has Schl\u00e4fli symbol { }\u00d7{n}. It approaches a cylinder as n approaches infinity.\n\n\n=== Special cases ===\nA right rectangular prism (with a rectangular base) is also called a cuboid, or informally a rectangular box. A right rectangular prism has Schl\u00e4fli symbol { }\u00d7{ }\u00d7{ }.A right square prism (with a square base) is also called a square cuboid, or informally a square box.Note: some texts may apply the term rectangular prism or square prism to both a right rectangular-based prism and a right square-based prism.\n\n\n== Regular prism ==\nA regular prism is a prism with regular bases.\n\n\n== Uniform prism ==\nA uniform prism or semiregular prism is a right prism with regular bases and all edges of the same length.\nThus all the side faces of a uniform prism are squares.\nThus all the faces of a uniform prism are regular polygons. Also, such prisms are isogonal; thus they are uniform polyhedra alright. They form one of the two infinite series of semiregular polyhedra, the other series being formed by the antiprisms.\nA uniform n-gonal prism has Schl\u00e4fli symbol t{2,n}.\n\n\n== Volume ==\nThe volume of a prism is the product of the area of the base by the height, i.e. the distance between the two base faces (in the case of a non-right prism, note that this means the perpendicular distance).\nThe volume is therefore:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        B\n        h\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=Bh,}\n  where B is the base area and h is the height.\nThe volume of a prism whose base is an n-sided regular polygon with side length s is therefore:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            n\n            4\n          \n        \n        h\n        \n          s\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        cot\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n              n\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {n}{4}}hs^{2}\\cot \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{n}}\\right).}\n  \n\n\n== Surface area ==\nThe surface area of a right prism is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        B\n        +\n        P\n        h\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2B+Ph,}\n  where B is the area of the base, h the height, and P the base perimeter.\nThe surface area of a right prism whose base is a regular n-sided polygon with side length s, and with height h, is therefore:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          \n            n\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          s\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        cot\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n              n\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        +\n        n\n        s\n        h\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {n}{2}}s^{2}\\cot \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{n}}\\right)+nsh.}\n  \n\n\n== Schlegel diagrams ==\n\n\n== Symmetry ==\nThe symmetry group of a right n-sided prism with regular base is Dnh of order 4n, except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group Oh of order 48, which has three versions of D4h as subgroups. The rotation group is Dn of order 2n, except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D4 as subgroups.\nThe symmetry group Dnh contains inversion iff n is even.\nThe hosohedra and dihedra also possess dihedral symmetry, and an n-gonal prism can be constructed via the geometrical truncation of an n-gonal hosohedron, as well as through the cantellation or expansion of an n-gonal dihedron.\n\n\n== Truncated prism ==\nA truncated prism is a prism with non-parallel top and bottom faces.\n\n\n== Twisted prism ==\nA twisted prism is a nonconvex polyhedron constructed from a uniform n-prism with each side face bisected on the square diagonal, by twisting the top, usually by \u03c0/n radians (180/n degrees) in the same direction, causing sides to be concave.A twisted prism cannot be dissected into tetrahedra without adding new vertices. The smallest case: the triangular form, is called a Sch\u00f6nhardt polyhedron.\nAn n-gonal twisted prism is topologically identical to the n-gonal uniform antiprism, but has half the symmetry group: Dn, [n,2]+, order 2n. It can be seen as a nonconvex antiprism, with tetrahedra removed between pairs of triangles.\n\n\n== Frustum ==\nA frustum is a similar construction to a prism, with trapezoid lateral faces and differently sized top and bottom polygons.\n\n\n== Star prism ==\n\nA star prism is a nonconvex polyhedron constructed by two identical star polygon faces on the top and bottom, being parallel and offset by a distance and connected by rectangular faces. A uniform star prism will have Schl\u00e4fli symbol {p/q} \u00d7 { }, with p rectangle and 2 {p/q} faces. It is topologically identical to a p-gonal prism.\n\n\n=== Crossed prism ===\nA crossed prism is a nonconvex polyhedron constructed from a prism, where the vertices of one base are inverted around the center of this base (or rotated by 180\u00b0). This transforms the side rectangular faces into crossed rectangles. For a regular polygon base, the appearance is an n-gonal hour glass. All oblique edges pass through a single body center. Note: no vertex is at this body centre. A crossed prism is topologically identical to an n-gonal prism.\n\n\n=== Toroidal prism ===\nA toroidal prism is a nonconvex polyhedron like a crossed prism, but without bottom and top base faces, and with simple rectangular side faces closing the polyhedron. This can only be done for even-sided base polygons. These are topological tori, with Euler characteristic of zero. The topological polyhedral net can be cut from two rows of a square tiling (with vertex configuration 4.4.4.4): a band of n squares, each attached to a crossed rectangle. An n-gonal toroidal prism has 2n vertices, 2n faces: n squares and n crossed rectangles, and 4n edges. It is topologically self-dual.\n\n\n== Prismatic polytope ==\nA prismatic polytope is a higher-dimensional generalization of a prism. An n-dimensional prismatic polytope is constructed from two (n \u2212 1)-dimensional polytopes, translated into the next dimension.\nThe prismatic n-polytope elements are doubled from the (n \u2212 1)-polytope elements and then creating new elements from the next lower element.\nTake an n-polytope with fi i-face elements (i = 0, ..., n). Its (n + 1)-polytope prism will have 2fi + fi\u22121 i-face elements. (With f\u22121 = 0, fn = 1.)\nBy dimension:\n\nTake a polygon with n vertices, n edges. Its prism has 2n vertices, 3n edges, and 2 + n faces.\nTake a polyhedron with v vertices, e edges, and f faces. Its prism has 2v vertices, 2e + v edges, 2f + e faces, and 2 + f cells.\nTake a polychoron with v vertices, e edges, f faces, and c cells. Its prism has 2v vertices, 2e + v edges, 2f + e faces,  2c + f cells, and 2 + c hypercells.\n\n\n=== Uniform prismatic polytope ===\n\nA regular n-polytope represented by Schl\u00e4fli symbol {p,q,...,t} can form a uniform prismatic (n + 1)-polytope represented by a Cartesian product of two Schl\u00e4fli symbols: {p,q,...,t}\u00d7{ }.\nBy dimension:\n\nA 0-polytopic prism is a line segment, represented by an empty Schl\u00e4fli symbol { }.\n\nA 1-polytopic prism is a rectangle, made from 2 translated line segments. It is represented as the product Schl\u00e4fli symbol { }\u00d7{ }. If it is square, symmetry can be reduced: { }\u00d7{ } = {4}.\nExample: , Square, { }\u00d7{ }, two parallel line segments, connected by two line segment sides.\nA polygonal prism is a 3-dimensional prism made from two translated polygons connected by rectangles. A regular polygon {p} can construct a uniform n-gonal prism represented by the product {p}\u00d7{ }. If p = 4, with square sides symmetry it becomes a cube: {4}\u00d7{ } = {4,3}.\nExample: , Pentagonal prism, {5}\u00d7{ }, two parallel pentagons connected by 5 rectangular sides.\nA polyhedral prism is a 4-dimensional prism made from two translated polyhedra connected by 3-dimensional prism cells. A regular polyhedron {p,q} can construct the uniform polychoric prism, represented by the product {p,q}\u00d7{ }. If the polyhedron and the sides are cubes, it becomes a tesseract: {4,3}\u00d7{ } = {4,3,3}.\nExample: , Dodecahedral prism, {5,3}\u00d7{ }, two parallel dodecahedra connected by 12 pentagonal prism sides.\n...\nHigher order prismatic polytopes also exist as cartesian products of any two or more polytopes. The dimension of a product polytope is the sum of the dimensions of its elements. The first examples of these exist in 4-dimensional space; they are called duoprisms as the product of two polygons in 4-dimensions.\nRegular duoprisms are represented as {p}\u00d7{q}, with pq vertices, 2pq edges, pq square faces, p q-gon faces, q p-gon faces, and bounded by p q-gonal prisms and q p-gonal prisms.\nFor example, {4}\u00d7{4}, a 4-4 duoprism is a lower symmetry form of a tesseract, as is {4,3}\u00d7{ }, a cubic prism. {4}\u00d7{4}\u00d7{ } (4-4 duoprism prism), {4,3}\u00d7{4} (cube-4 duoprism) and {4,3,3}\u00d7{ } (tesseractic prism) are lower symmetry forms of a 5-cube.\n\n\n== See also ==\nApeirogonal prism\nRectified prism\nPrismanes\nList of shapes\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAnthony Pugh (1976).

Informally, any sloping line is called diagonal.  The word diagonal derives from the ancient Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 diagonios, \"from angle to angle\" (from  \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac- dia-, \"through\", \"across\" and \u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 gonia, \"angle\", related to gony \"knee\"); it was used by both Strabo and Euclid to refer to a line connecting two vertices of a rhombus or cuboid, and later adopted into Latin as diagonus (\"slanting line\").\nIn matrix algebra, the diagonal of a square matrix consists of the entries on the line from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.\nThere are also other, non-mathematical uses.\n\n\n== Non-mathematical uses ==\n\nIn engineering, a diagonal brace is a beam used to brace a rectangular structure (such as scaffolding) to withstand strong forces pushing into it; although called a diagonal, due to practical considerations diagonal braces are often not connected to the corners of the rectangle.\nDiagonal pliers are wire-cutting pliers defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or \"on a diagonal\", hence the name.\nA diagonal lashing is a type of lashing used to bind spars or poles together applied so that the lashings cross over the poles at an angle.\nIn association football, the diagonal system of control is the method referees and assistant referees use to position themselves in one of the four quadrants of the pitch.\n\n\n== Polygons ==\nAs applied to a polygon, a diagonal is a line segment joining any two non-consecutive vertices.  Therefore, a quadrilateral has two diagonals, joining opposite pairs of vertices.  For any convex polygon, all the diagonals are inside the polygon, but for re-entrant polygons, some diagonals are outside of the polygon.\nAny n-sided polygon (n \u2265 3), convex or concave, has \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                n\n                (\n                n\n                \u2212\n                3\n                )\n              \n              2\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {n(n-3)}{2}}}\n   diagonals, as each vertex has diagonals to all other vertices except itself and the two adjacent vertices, or n \u2212 3 diagonals, and each diagonal is shared by two vertices.\n\n\n=== Regions formed by diagonals ===\nIn a convex polygon, if no three diagonals are concurrent at a single point in the interior, the number of regions that the diagonals divide the interior into is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              n\n              4\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              \n                n\n                \u2212\n                1\n              \n              2\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              (\n              n\n              \u2212\n              1\n              )\n              (\n              n\n              \u2212\n              2\n              )\n              (\n              \n                n\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              3\n              n\n              +\n              12\n              )\n            \n            24\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\binom {n}{4}}+{\\binom {n-1}{2}}={\\frac {(n-1)(n-2)(n^{2}-3n+12)}{24}}.}\n  For n-gons with n=3, 4, ... the number of regions is\n1, 4, 11, 25, 50, 91, 154, 246...This is OEIS sequence A006522.\n\n\n=== Intersections of diagonals ===\nIf no three diagonals of a convex polygon are concurrent at a point in the interior, the number of interior intersections of diagonals is given by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              n\n              4\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\binom {n}{4}}}\n  . This holds, for example, for any regular polygon with an odd number of sides. The formula follows from the fact that each intersection is uniquely determined by the four endpoints of the two intersecting diagonals: the number of intersections is thus the number of combinations of the n vertices four at a time.\n\n\n=== Regular polygons ===\n\nThere exist separate formulae for calculating the length of the longest diagonal in regular polygons with an even or odd number of sides.\nIn an even-sided regular polygon with n sides and side length a, the length of the longest diagonal is equivalent to the diameter of its circumcircle because the long diagonals all intersect each other at the polygon's center.

This plays an important part in geometry; for example, the fixed points of a mapping F from X to itself may be obtained by intersecting the graph of F with the diagonal.\nIn geometric studies, the idea of intersecting the diagonal with itself is common, not directly, but by perturbing it within an equivalence class. This is related at a deep level with the Euler characteristic and the zeros of vector fields. For example, the circle S1 has Betti numbers 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, and therefore Euler characteristic 0. A geometric way of expressing this is to look at the diagonal on the two-torus S1xS1 and observe that it can move off itself by the small motion (\u03b8, \u03b8) to (\u03b8, \u03b8 + \u03b5).  In general, the intersection number of the graph of a function with the diagonal may be computed using homology via the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem; the self-intersection of the diagonal is the special case of the identity function.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJordan normal form\nMain diagonal\nDiagonal functor\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBronson, Richard (1970), Matrix Methods: An Introduction, New York: Academic Press, LCCN 70097490\nCullen, Charles G.

John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r22 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms.

Transversals play a role in establishing whether two or more other lines in the Euclidean plane are parallel. The intersections of a transversal with two lines create various types of pairs of angles: consecutive interior angles, consecutive exterior angles, corresponding angles, and alternate angles. As a consequence of Euclid's parallel postulate, if the two lines are parallel, consecutive interior angles are supplementary, corresponding angles are equal, and alternate angles are equal.\n\n\n== Angles of a transversal ==\nA transversal produces 8 angles, as shown in the graph at the above left:\n\n4 with each of the two lines, namely \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 and then \u03b11, \u03b21, \u03b31 and \u03b41; and\n4 of which are interior (between the two lines), namely \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b31 and \u03b41 and 4 of which are exterior, namely \u03b11, \u03b21, \u03b3 and \u03b4.A transversal that cuts two parallel lines at right angles is called a perpendicular transversal. In this case, all 8 angles are right angles When the lines are parallel, a case that is often considered, a transversal produces several congruent supplementary angles. Some of these angle pairs have specific names and are discussed below: corresponding angles, alternate angles, and consecutive angles.:\u200aArt. 87\u200a\n\n\n=== Alternate angles ===\n\nAlternate angles are the four pairs of angles that:\n\nhave distinct vertex points,\nlie on opposite sides of the transversal and\nboth angles are interior or both angles are exterior.It is a very useful topic of mathematics \nIf the two angles of one pair are congruent (equal in measure), then the angles of each of the other pairs are also congruent.\nProposition 1.27 of Euclid's Elements, a theorem of absolute geometry (hence valid in both hyperbolic and Euclidean Geometry), proves that if the angles of a pair of alternate angles of a transversal are congruent then the two lines are parallel (non-intersecting).\nIt follows from Euclid's parallel postulate that if the two lines are parallel, then the angles of a pair of alternate angles of a transversal are congruent (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's Elements).\n\n\n=== Corresponding angles ===\n\nCorresponding angles are the four pairs of angles that:\n\nhave distinct vertex points,\nlie on the same side of the transversal and\none angle is interior and the other is exterior.Two lines are parallel if and only if the two angles of any pair of corresponding angles of any transversal are congruent (equal in measure). \nProposition 1.28 of Euclid's Elements, a theorem of absolute geometry (hence valid in both hyperbolic and Euclidean Geometry), proves that if the angles of a pair of corresponding angles of a transversal are congruent then the two lines are parallel (non-intersecting).\nIt follows from Euclid's parallel postulate that if the two lines are parallel, then the angles of a pair of corresponding angles of a transversal are congruent (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's Elements).\nIf the angles of one pair of corresponding angles are congruent, then the angles of each of the other pairs are also congruent.

Specifically, if the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are less than two right angles then lines must intersect. In fact, Euclid uses the same phrase in Greek that is usually translated as \"transversal\".:\u200a308,\u200anfote 1\u200aEuclid's Proposition 27 states that if a transversal intersects two lines so that alternate interior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. Euclid proves this by contradiction: If the lines are not parallel then they must intersect and a triangle is formed. Then one of the alternate angles is an exterior angle equal to the other angle which is an opposite interior angle in the triangle. This contradicts Proposition 16 which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is always greater than the opposite interior angles.:\u200a307\u200a:\u200aArt. 88\u200aEuclid's Proposition 28 extends this result in two ways. First, if a transversal intersects two lines so that corresponding angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. Second, if a transversal intersects two lines so that interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary, then the lines are parallel. These follow from the previous proposition by applying the fact that opposite angles of intersecting lines are equal (Prop. 15) and that adjacent angles on a line are supplementary (Prop. 13). As noted by Proclus, Euclid gives only three of a possible six such criteria for parallel lines.:\u200a309\u2013310\u200a:\u200aArt. 89-90\u200aEuclid's Proposition 29 is a converse to the previous two. First, if a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then the alternate interior angles are congruent. If not, then one is greater than the other, which implies its supplement is less than the supplement of the other angle. This implies that there are interior angles on the same side of the transversal which are less than two right angles, contradicting the fifth postulate. The proposition continues by stating that on a transversal of two parallel lines, corresponding angles are congruent and the interior angles on the same side are equal to two right angles. These statements follow in the same way that Prop. 28 follows from Prop. 27.:\u200a311\u2013312\u200a:\u200aArt. 93-95\u200aEuclid's proof makes essential use of the fifth postulate, however, modern treatments of geometry use Playfair's axiom instead. To prove proposition 29 assuming Playfair's axiom, let a transversal cross two parallel lines and suppose that the alternate interior angles are not equal. Draw a third line through the point where the transversal crosses the first line, but with an angle equal to the angle the transversal makes with the second line. This produces two different lines through a point, both parallel to another line, contradicting the axiom.:\u200a313\u200a\n\n\n== In higher dimensions ==\nIn higher dimensional spaces, a line that intersects each of a set of lines in distinct points is a transversal of that set of lines. Unlike the two-dimensional (plane) case, transversals are not guaranteed to exist for sets of more than two lines.\nIn Euclidean 3-space, a regulus is a set of skew lines, R, such that through each point on each line of R, there passes a transversal of R and through each point of a transversal of R there passes a line of R. The set of transversals of a regulus R is also a regulus, called the opposite regulus, Ro. In this space, three mutually skew lines can always be extended to a regulus.\n\n\n== References ==", "Sphere": "A sphere (from Ancient Greek  \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 (spha\u00eera) 'globe, ball') is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional circle. A sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in three-dimensional space. That given point is the centre of the sphere, and r is the sphere's radius. The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians.\nThe sphere is a fundamental object in many fields of mathematics. Spheres and nearly-spherical shapes also appear in nature and industry. Bubbles such as soap bubbles take a spherical shape in equilibrium. The Earth is often approximated as a sphere in geography, and the celestial sphere is an important concept in astronomy. Manufactured items including pressure vessels and most curved mirrors and lenses are based on spheres. Spheres roll smoothly in any direction, so most balls used in sports and toys are spherical, as are ball bearings.\n\n\n== Basic terminology ==\n\nAs mentioned earlier r is the sphere's radius; any line from the center to a point on the sphere is also called a radius.If a radius is extended through the center to the opposite side of the sphere, it creates a diameter. Like the radius, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter, and denoted d. Diameters are the longest line segments that can be drawn between two points on the sphere: their length is twice the radius, d = 2r. Two points on the sphere connected by a diameter are antipodal points of each other.A unit sphere is a sphere with unit radius (r = 1). For convenience, spheres are often taken to have their center at the origin of the coordinate system, and spheres in this article have their center at the origin unless a center is mentioned.\n\nA great circle on the sphere has the same center and radius as the sphere, and divides it into two equal hemispheres.\nAlthough the Earth is not perfectly spherical, terms borrowed from geography are convenient to apply to the sphere.\nIf a particular point on a sphere is (arbitrarily) designated as its north pole, its antipodal point is called the south pole. The great circle equidistant to each is then the equator. Great circles through the poles are called lines of longitude or meridians. A line connecting the two poles may be called the axis of rotation. Small circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are lines of latitude. In geometry unrelated to astronomical bodies, geocentric terminology should be used only for illustration and noted as such, unless there is no chance of misunderstanding.Mathematicians consider a sphere to be a two-dimensional closed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. They draw a distinction a sphere and a ball, which is a three-dimensional manifold with boundary that includes the volume contained by the sphere. An open ball excludes the sphere itself, while a closed ball includes the sphere: a closed ball is the union of the open ball and the sphere, and a sphere is the boundary of a (closed or open) ball. The distinction between ball and sphere has not always been maintained and especially older mathematical references talk about a sphere as a solid. The distinction between \"circle\" and \"disk\" in the plane is similar.\nSmall spheres or balls are sometimes called spherules, e.g. in Martian spherules.\n\n\n== Equations ==\nIn analytic geometry, a sphere with center (x0, y0, z0) and radius r is the locus of all points (x, y, z) such that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        (\n        y\n        \u2212\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        (\n        z\n        \u2212\n        \n          z\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}+(z-z_{0})^{2}=r^{2}.}\n  Since it can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial, a sphere is a quadric surface, a type of algebraic surface.Let a, b, c, d, e be real numbers with a \u2260 0 and put\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2212\n              b\n            \n            a\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2212\n              c\n            \n            a\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          z\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2212\n              d\n            \n            a\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                b\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              \n                c\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              \n                d\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              a\n              e\n            \n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{0}={\\frac {-b}{a}},\\quad y_{0}={\\frac {-c}{a}},\\quad z_{0}={\\frac {-d}{a}},\\quad \\rho ={\\frac {b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}-ae}{a^{2}}}.}\n  Then the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        a\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        +\n        2\n        (\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        y\n        +\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        +\n        e\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=a(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})+2(bx+cy+dz)+e=0}\n  has no real points as solutions if \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        <\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho <0}\n   and is called the equation of an imaginary sphere.

Archimedes first derived this formula by showing that the volume inside a sphere is twice the volume between the sphere and the circumscribed cylinder of that sphere (having the height and diameter equal to the diameter of the sphere). This may be proved by inscribing a cone upside down into semi-sphere, noting that the area of a cross section of the cone plus the area of a cross section of the sphere is the same as the area of the cross section of the circumscribing cylinder, and applying Cavalieri's principle. This formula can also be derived using integral calculus, i.e. disk integration to sum the volumes of an infinite number of circular disks of infinitesimally small thickness stacked side by side and centered along the x-axis from x = \u2212r to x = r, assuming the sphere of radius r is centered at the origin.\n\nFor most practical purposes, the volume inside a sphere inscribed in a cube can be approximated as 52.4% of the volume of the cube, since V = \u03c0/6 d3, where d is the diameter of the sphere and also the length of a side of the cube and \u03c0/6 \u2248 0.5236. For example, a sphere with diameter 1 m has 52.4% the volume of a cube with edge length 1 m, or about 0.524 m3.\n\n\n=== Surface area ===\nThe surface area of a sphere of radius r is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        4\n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=4\\pi r^{2}.}\n  Archimedes first derived this formula from the fact that the projection to the lateral surface of a circumscribed cylinder is area-preserving. Another approach to obtaining the formula comes from the fact that it equals the derivative of the formula for the volume with respect to r because the total volume inside a sphere of radius r can be thought of as the summation of the surface area of an infinite number of spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness concentrically stacked inside one another from radius 0 to radius r. At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius r is simply the product of the surface area at radius r and the infinitesimal thickness.\n\nThe sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. The sphere therefore appears in nature: for example, bubbles and small water drops are roughly spherical because the surface tension locally minimizes surface area.\nThe surface area relative to the mass of a ball is called the specific surface area and can be expressed from the above stated equations as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          S\n          A\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            A\n            \n              V\n              \u03c1\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            3\n            \n              r\n              \u03c1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {SSA} ={\\frac {A}{V\\rho }}={\\frac {3}{r\\rho }}}\n  where \u03c1 is the density (the ratio of mass to volume).\n\n\n=== Other geometric properties ===\nA sphere can be constructed as the surface formed by rotating a circle about any of its diameters; this is essentially the traditional definition of a sphere as given in Euclid's Elements. Since a circle is a special type of ellipse, a sphere is a special type of ellipsoid of revolution. Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its major axis, the shape becomes a prolate spheroid; rotated about the minor axis, an oblate spheroid.A sphere is uniquely determined by four points that are not coplanar. More generally, a sphere is uniquely determined by four conditions such as passing through a point, being tangent to a plane, etc. This property is analogous to the property that three non-collinear points determine a unique circle in a plane.\nConsequently, a sphere is uniquely determined by (that is, passes through) a circle and a point not in the plane of that circle.\nBy examining the common solutions of the equations of two spheres, it can be seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the radical plane of the intersecting spheres. Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no real point in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).The angle between two spheres at a real point of intersection is the dihedral angle determined by the tangent planes to the spheres at that point. Two spheres intersect at the same angle at all points of their circle of intersection. They intersect at right angles (are orthogonal) if and only if the square of the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of the squares of their radii.\n\n\n==== Pencil of spheres ====\n\nIf f(x, y, z) = 0 and g(x, y, z) = 0 are the equations of two distinct spheres then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        s\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        +\n        t\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle sf(x,y,z)+tg(x,y,z)=0}\n  is also the equation of a sphere for arbitrary values of the parameters s and t. The set of all spheres satisfying this equation is called a pencil of spheres determined by the original two spheres. In this definition a sphere is allowed to be a plane (infinite radius, center at infinity) and if both the original spheres are planes then all the spheres of the pencil are planes, otherwise there is only one plane (the radical plane) in the pencil.\n\n\n=== Properties of the sphere ===\n\nIn their book Geometry and the Imagination, David Hilbert and Stephan Cohn-Vossen describe eleven properties of the sphere and discuss whether these properties uniquely determine the sphere. Several properties hold for the plane, which can be thought of as a sphere with infinite radius. These properties are:\n\nThe points on the sphere are all the same distance from a fixed point. Also, the ratio of the distance of its points from two fixed points is constant.\nThe first part is the usual definition of the sphere and determines it uniquely. The second part can be easily deduced and follows a similar result of Apollonius of Perga for the circle. This second part also holds for the plane.\nThe contours and plane sections of the sphere are circles.\nThis property defines the sphere uniquely.\nThe sphere has constant width and constant girth.\nThe width of a surface is the distance between pairs of parallel tangent planes. Numerous other closed convex surfaces have constant width, for example the Meissner body. The girth of a surface is the circumference of the boundary of its orthogonal projection on to a plane. Each of these properties implies the other.\nAll points of a sphere are umbilics.\nAt any point on a surface a normal direction is at right angles to the surface because on the sphere these are the lines radiating out from the center of the sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a normal section, and the curvature of this curve is the normal curvature. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the principal curvatures. Any closed surface will have at least four points called umbilical points. At an umbilic all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the principal curvatures are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.\nFor the sphere the curvatures of all normal sections are equal, so every point is an umbilic. The sphere and plane are the only surfaces with this property.\nThe sphere does not have a surface of centers.\nFor a given normal section exists a circle of curvature that equals the sectional curvature, is tangent to the surface, and the center lines of which lie along on the normal line. For example, the two centers corresponding to the maximum and minimum sectional curvatures are called the focal points, and the set of all such centers forms the focal surface.\nFor most surfaces the focal surface forms two sheets that are each a surface and meet at umbilical points. Several cases are special:\n* For channel surfaces one sheet forms a curve and the other sheet is a surface\n* For cones, cylinders, tori and cyclides both sheets form curves.\n* For the sphere the center of every osculating circle is at the center of the sphere and the focal surface forms a single point. This property is unique to the sphere.\nAll geodesics of the sphere are closed curves.\nGeodesics are curves on a surface that give the shortest distance between two points. They are a generalization of the concept of a straight line in the plane. For the sphere the geodesics are great circles. Many other surfaces share this property.\nOf all the solids having a given volume, the sphere is the one with the smallest surface area; of all solids having a given surface area, the sphere is the one having the greatest volume.\nIt follows from isoperimetric inequality. These properties define the sphere uniquely and can be seen in soap bubbles: a soap bubble will enclose a fixed volume, and surface tension minimizes its surface area for that volume. A freely floating soap bubble therefore approximates a sphere (though such external forces as gravity will slightly distort the bubble's shape). It can also be seen in planets and stars where gravity minimizes surface area for large celestial bodies.\nThe sphere has the smallest total mean curvature among all convex solids with a given surface area.\nThe mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures, which is constant because the two principal curvatures are constant at all points of the sphere.\nThe sphere has constant mean curvature.\nThe sphere is the only imbedded surface that lacks boundary or singularities with constant positive mean curvature. Other such immersed surfaces as minimal surfaces have constant mean curvature.\nThe sphere has constant positive Gaussian curvature.\nGaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures. It is an intrinsic property that can be determined by measuring length and angles and is independent of how the surface is embedded in space. Hence, bending a surface will not alter the Gaussian curvature, and other surfaces with constant positive Gaussian curvature can be obtained by cutting a small slit in the sphere and bending it. All these other surfaces would have boundaries, and the sphere is the only surface that lacks a boundary with constant, positive Gaussian curvature. The pseudosphere is an example of a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature.\nThe sphere is transformed into itself by a three-parameter family of rigid motions.\nRotating around any axis a unit sphere at the origin will map the sphere onto itself. Any rotation about a line through the origin can be expressed as a combination of rotations around the three-coordinate axis (see Euler angles). Therefore, a three-parameter family of rotations exists such that each rotation transforms the sphere onto itself; this family is the rotation group SO(3). The plane is the only other surface with a three-parameter family of transformations (translations along the x- and y-axes and rotations around the origin). Circular cylinders are the only surfaces with two-parameter families of rigid motions and the surfaces of revolution and helicoids are the only surfaces with a one-parameter family.\n\n\n== Treatment by area of mathematics ==\n\n\n=== Spherical geometry ===\n\nThe basic elements of Euclidean plane geometry are points and lines. On the sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The analogue of the \"line\" is the geodesic, which is a great circle; the defining characteristic of a great circle is that the plane containing all its points also passes through the center of the sphere. Measuring by arc length shows that the shortest path between two points lying on the sphere is the shorter segment of the great circle that includes the points.\nMany theorems from classical geometry hold true for spherical geometry as well, but not all do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's postulates, including the parallel postulate. In spherical trigonometry, angles are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle always exceeds 180 degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.\nAny pair of points on a sphere that lie on a straight line through the sphere's center (i.e. the diameter) are called antipodal points\u2014on the sphere, the distance between them is exactly half the length of the circumference. Any other (i.e. not antipodal) pair of distinct points on a sphere\n\nlie on a unique great circle,\nsegment it into one minor (i.e. shorter) and one major (i.e. longer) arc, and\nhave the minor arc's length be the shortest distance between them on the sphere.Spherical geometry is a form of elliptic geometry, which together with hyperbolic geometry makes up non-Euclidean geometry.\n\n\n=== Differential geometry ===\nThe sphere is a smooth surface with constant Gaussian curvature at each point equal to 1/r2. As per Gauss's Theorema Egregium, this curvature is independent of the sphere's embedding in 3-dimensional space. Also following from Gauss, a sphere cannot be mapped to a plane while maintaining both areas and angles. Therefore, any map projection introduces some form of distortion.\nA sphere of radius r has area element \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        A\n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        \n        d\n        \u03b8\n        \n        d\n        \u03c6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dA=r^{2}\\sin \\theta \\,d\\theta \\,d\\varphi }\n  . This can be found from the volume element in spherical coordinates with r held constant.A sphere of any radius centered at zero is an integral surface of the following differential form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n        d\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        \n        d\n        y\n        +\n        z\n        \n        d\n        z\n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\,dx+y\\,dy+z\\,dz=0.}\n  This equation reflects that the position vector and tangent plane at a point are always orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, the outward-facing normal vector is equal to the position vector scaled by 1/r.\nIn Riemannian geometry, the filling area conjecture states that the hemisphere is the optimal (least area) isometric filling of the Riemannian circle.\n\n\n=== Topology ===\nRemarkably, it is possible to turn an ordinary sphere inside out in a three-dimensional space with possible self-intersections but without creating any creases, in a process called sphere eversion.\nThe antipodal quotient of the sphere is the surface called the real projective plane, which can also be thought of as the Northern Hemisphere with antipodal points of the equator identified.\n\n\n== Curves on a sphere ==\n\n\n=== Circles ===\n\nCircles on the sphere are, like circles in the plane, made up of all points a certain distance from a fixed point on the sphere. The intersection of a sphere and a plane is a circle, a point, or empty. Great circles are the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing through the center of a sphere: others are called small circles.\nMore complicated surfaces may intersect a sphere in circles, too: the intersection of a sphere with a surface of revolution whose axis contains the center of the sphere (are coaxial) consists of circles and/or points if not empty. For example, the diagram to the right shows the intersection of a sphere and a cylinder, which consists of two circles. If the cylinder radius were that of the sphere, the intersection would be a single circle. If the cylinder radius were larger than that of the sphere, the intersection would be empty.\n\n\n=== Loxodrome ===\n\nIn navigation, a rhumb line or loxodrome is an arc crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle. Loxodromes are the same as straight lines in the Mercator projection. A rhumb line is not a spherical spiral. Except for some simple cases, the formula of a rhumb line is complicated.\n\n\n=== Clelia curves ===\n\nA Clelia curve is a curve on a sphere for which the longitude \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi }\n   and the colatitude \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   satisfy the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        =\n        c\n        \n        \u03b8\n        ,\n        \n        c\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi =c\\;\\theta ,\\quad c>0}\n  .Special cases are: Viviani's curve (\n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c=1}\n  ) and spherical spirals (\n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        >\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c>2}\n  ) such as Seiffert's spiral. Clelia curves approximate the path of satellites in polar orbit.\n\n\n=== Spherical conics ===\n\nThe analog of a conic section on the sphere is a spherical conic, a quartic curve which can be defined in several equivalent ways, including:\n\nas the intersection of a sphere with a quadratic cone whose vertex is the sphere center;\nas the intersection of a sphere with an elliptic or hyperbolic cylinder whose axis passes through the sphere center;\nas the locus of points whose sum or difference of great-circle distances from a pair of foci is a constant.Many theorems relating to planar conic sections also extend to spherical conics.\n\n\n=== Intersection of a sphere with a more general surface ===\n\nIf a sphere is intersected by another surface, there may be more complicated spherical curves.\n\nExample\nsphere \u2013 cylinder\nThe intersection of the sphere with equation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\;x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=r^{2}\\;}\n   and the cylinder with equation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        (\n        y\n        \u2212\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \u2260\n        0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\;(y-y_{0})^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2},\\;y_{0}\\neq 0\\;}\n   is not just one or two circles.

More exactly, it is the image of a sphere under an affine transformation. An ellipsoid bears the same relationship to the sphere that an ellipse does to a circle.\n\n\n=== Dimensionality ===\n\nSpheres can be generalized to spaces of any number of dimensions. For any natural number n, an n-sphere, often denoted S\u200dn, is the set of points in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space that are at a fixed distance r from a central point of that space, where r is, as before, a positive real number. In particular:\n\nS\u200d0: a 0-sphere consists of two discrete points, \u2212r and r\nS\u200d1: a 1-sphere is a circle of radius r\nS\u200d2: a 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere\nS\u200d3: a 3-sphere is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.Spheres for n > 2 are sometimes called hyperspheres.\nThe n-sphere of unit radius centered at the origin is denoted S\u200dn and is often referred to as \"the\" n-sphere. The ordinary sphere is a 2-sphere, because it is a 2-dimensional surface which is embedded in 3-dimensional space.\nIn topology, the n-sphere is an example of a compact topological manifold without boundary. A topological sphere need not be smooth; if it is smooth, it need not be diffeomorphic to the Euclidean sphere (an exotic sphere).\nThe sphere is the inverse image of a one-point set under the continuous function \u2016x\u2016, so it is closed; Sn is also bounded, so it is compact by the Heine\u2013Borel theorem.\n\n\n=== Metric spaces ===\n\nMore generally, in a metric space (E,d), the sphere of center x and radius r > 0 is the set of points y such that d(x,y) = r.\nIf the center is a distinguished point that is considered to be the origin of E, as in a normed space, it is not mentioned in the definition and notation. The same applies for the radius if it is taken to equal one, as in the case of a unit sphere.\nUnlike a ball, even a large sphere may be an empty set. For example, in Zn with Euclidean metric, a sphere of radius r is nonempty only if r2 can be written as sum of n squares of integers.\nAn octahedron is a sphere in taxicab geometry, and a cube is a sphere in geometry using the Chebyshev distance.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe geometry of the sphere was studied by the Greeks. Euclid's Elements defines the sphere in book XI, discusses various properties of the sphere in book XII, and shows how to inscribe the five regular polyhedra within a sphere in book XIII. Euclid does not include the area and volume of a sphere, only a theorem that the volume of a sphere varies as the third power of its diameter, probably due to Eudoxus of Cnidus. The volume and area formulas were first determined in Archimedes's On the Sphere and Cylinder by the method of exhaustion. Zenodorus was the first to state that, for a given surface area, the sphere is the solid of maximum volume.Archimedes wrote about the problem of dividing a sphere into segments whose volumes are in a given ratio, but did not solve it. A solution by means of the parabola and hyperbola was given by Dionysodorus. A similar problem \u2014 to construct a segment equal in volume to a given segment, and in surface to another segment \u2014 was solved later by al-Quhi.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Regions ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\nAlbert, Abraham Adrian (2016) [1949], Solid Analytic Geometry, Dover, ISBN 978-0-486-81026-3.\nDunham, William (1997).

Reflections are sometimes excluded from the definition of a rigid transformation by requiring that the transformation also preserve the handedness of objects in the Euclidean space. (A reflection would not preserve handedness; for instance, it would transform a left hand into a right hand.)  To avoid ambiguity, a transformation that preserves handedness is known as a proper rigid transformation, or rototranslation. Any proper rigid transformation can be decomposed into a rotation followed by a translation, while any improper rigid transformation can be decomposed into an improper rotation followed by a translation, or into a sequence of reflections.\nAny object will keep the same shape and size after a proper rigid transformation.\nAll rigid transformations are examples of affine transformations. The set of all (proper and improper) rigid transformations is a mathematical group called the Euclidean group, denoted E(n) for n-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The set of proper rigid transformations is called special Euclidean group, denoted SE(n).\nIn kinematics, proper rigid transformations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space, denoted SE(3), are used to represent the linear and angular displacement of rigid bodies. According to Chasles' theorem, every rigid transformation can be expressed as a screw displacement.\n\n\n== Formal definition ==\nA rigid transformation is formally defined as a transformation that, when acting on any vector v, produces a transformed vector T(v) of the form\n\nwhere RT = R\u22121 (i.e., R is an orthogonal transformation), and t is a vector giving the translation of the origin.\nA proper rigid transformation has, in addition,\n\nwhich means that R does not produce a reflection, and hence it represents a rotation (an orientation-preserving orthogonal transformation). Indeed, when an orthogonal transformation matrix produces a reflection, its determinant is \u22121.\n\n\n== Distance formula ==\nA measure of distance between points, or metric, is needed in order to confirm that a transformation is rigid.  The Euclidean distance formula for Rn is the generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.  The formula gives the distance squared between two points X and Y as the sum of the squares of the distances along the coordinate axes, that is\n\nwhere X = (X1, X2, ..., Xn) and Y = (Y1, Y2, ..., Yn), and the dot denotes the scalar product.\nUsing this distance formula, a rigid transformation g : Rn \u2192 Rn has the property,\n\n\n== Translations and linear transformations ==\nA translation of a vector space adds a vector d to every vector in the space, which means it is the transformation \n\nIt is easy to show that this is a rigid transformation by showing that the distance between translated vectors equal the distance between the original vectors:\n\nA linear transformation of a vector space, L : Rn \u2192 Rn, preserves linear combinations,\n\nA linear transformation L can be represented by a matrix, which means \n\nwhere [L] is an n\u00d7n matrix.\nA linear transformation is a rigid transformation if it satisfies the condition,\n\nthat is\n\nNow use the fact that the scalar product of two vectors v.w can be written as the matrix operation vTw, where the T denotes the matrix transpose, we have\n\nThus, the linear transformation L is rigid if its matrix satisfies the condition\n\nwhere [I] is the identity matrix.  Matrices that satisfy this condition are called orthogonal matrices.  This condition actually requires the columns of these matrices to be orthogonal unit vectors.\nMatrices that satisfy this condition form a mathematical group under the operation of matrix multiplication called the orthogonal group of n\u00d7n matrices and denoted O(n).\nCompute the determinant of the condition for an orthogonal matrix to obtain\n\nwhich shows that the matrix [L] can have a determinant of either +1 or \u22121.  Orthogonal matrices with determinant \u22121 are reflections, and those with determinant +1 are rotations.  Notice that the set of orthogonal matrices can be viewed as consisting of two manifolds in Rn\u00d7n separated by the set of singular matrices.\nThe set of rotation matrices is called the special orthogonal group, and denoted SO(n).  It is an example of a Lie group because it has the structure of a manifold.\n\n\n== References ==", "Pyramid_(geometry)": "In geometry, a pyramid (from Ancient Greek  \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03c2 (puram\u00eds)) is a polyhedron formed by connecting a polygonal base and a point, called the apex. Each base edge and apex form a triangle, called a lateral face. It is a conic solid with polygonal base.  A pyramid with an n-sided base has n + 1 vertices, n + 1 faces, and 2n edges. All pyramids are self-dual.\nA right pyramid has its apex directly above the centroid of its base. Nonright pyramids are called oblique pyramids. A regular pyramid has a regular polygon base and is usually implied to be a right pyramid.When unspecified, a pyramid is usually assumed to be a regular square pyramid, like the physical pyramid structures. A triangle-based pyramid is more often called a tetrahedron.\nAmong oblique pyramids, like acute and obtuse triangles, a pyramid can be called acute if its apex is above the interior of the base and obtuse if its apex is above the exterior of the base. A right-angled pyramid has its apex above an edge or vertex of the base. In a tetrahedron these qualifiers change based on which face is considered the base.\nPyramids are a class of the prismatoids. Pyramids can be doubled into bipyramids by adding a second offset point on the other side of the base plane.\n\n\n== Right pyramids with a regular base ==\nA right pyramid with a regular base has isosceles triangle sides, with symmetry is Cnv or [1,n], with order 2n. It can be given an extended Schl\u00e4fli symbol ( ) \u2228 {n}, representing a point, ( ), joined (orthogonally offset) to a regular polygon, {n}. A join operation creates a new edge between all pairs of vertices of the two joined figures.The trigonal or triangular pyramid with all equilateral triangle faces becomes the regular tetrahedron, one of the Platonic solids. A lower symmetry case of the triangular pyramid is C3v, which has an equilateral triangle base, and 3 identical isosceles triangle sides. The square and pentagonal pyramids can also be composed of regular convex polygons, in which case they are Johnson solids.\nIf all edges of a square pyramid (or any convex polyhedron) are tangent to a sphere so that the average position of the tangential points are at the center of the sphere, then the pyramid is said to be canonical, and it forms half of a regular octahedron.\nPyramids with a hexagon or higher base must be composed of isosceles triangles. A hexagonal pyramid with equilateral triangles would be a completely flat figure, and a heptagonal or higher would have the triangles not meet at all. \n\n\n=== Right star pyramids ===\nRight pyramids with regular star polygon bases are called star pyramids. For example, the pentagrammic pyramid has a pentagram base and 5 intersecting triangle sides.\n\n\n== Right pyramids with an irregular base ==\n\nA right pyramid can be named as ( )\u2228P, where ( ) is the apex point, \u2228 is a join operator, and P is a base polygon.\nAn isosceles triangle right tetrahedron can be written as ( )\u2228[( )\u2228{ }] as the join of a point to an isosceles triangle base, as [( )\u2228( )]\u2228{ } or { }\u2228{ } as the join (orthogonal offsets) of two orthogonal segments, a digonal disphenoid, containing 4 isosceles triangle faces. It has C1v symmetry from two different base-apex orientations, and C2v in its full symmetry.\nA rectangular right pyramid, written as ( )\u2228[{ }\u00d7{ }], and a rhombic pyramid, as ( )\u2228[{ }+{ }], both have symmetry C2v.\n\n\n== Volume ==\n\nThe volume of a pyramid (also any cone) is \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              3\n            \n          \n        \n        b\n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle V={\\tfrac {1}{3}}bh}\n  , where b is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. This works for any polygon, regular or non-regular, and any location of the apex, provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane containing the base. In 499 AD Aryabhata, a mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, used this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).\nThe formula can be formally proved using calculus. By similarity, the linear dimensions of a cross-section parallel to the base increase linearly from the apex to the base.

Consider a unit cube.  Draw lines from the center of the cube to each of the 8 vertices.  This partitions the cube into 6 equal square pyramids of base area 1 and height 1/2.  Each pyramid clearly has volume of 1/6.  From this we deduce that pyramid volume = height \u00d7 base area / 3.\nNext, expand the cube uniformly in three directions by  unequal amounts so that the resulting rectangular solid edges are a, b and c, with solid volume abc. Each of the 6 pyramids within are likewise expanded.  And each pyramid has the same volume abc/6.  Since pairs of pyramids have heights a/2, b/2 and c/2, we see that pyramid volume = height \u00d7 base area / 3 again.\nWhen the side triangles are equilateral, the formula for the volume is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            12\n          \n        \n        n\n        \n          s\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        cot\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n              n\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n          \n            1\n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                1\n                \n                  4\n                  \n                    sin\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \u2061\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \u03c0\n                        n\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {1}{12}}ns^{3}\\cot \\left({\\frac {\\pi }{n}}\\right){\\sqrt {1-{\\frac {1}{4\\sin ^{2}{\\tfrac {\\pi }{n}}}}}}.}\n  This formula only applies for n = 2, 3, 4 and 5; and it also covers the case n = 6, for which the volume equals zero (i.e., the pyramid height is zero).\n\n\n== Surface area ==\nThe surface area of a pyramid is \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n        A\n        =\n        B\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        P\n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle SA=B+{\\tfrac {1}{2}}PL}\n  , where B is the base area, P is the base perimeter, and the slant height \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              h\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              r\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle L={\\sqrt {h^{2}+r^{2}}}}\n  , where h is the pyramid altitude and r is the inradius of the base.\n\n\n== Centroid ==\nThe centroid of a pyramid is located on the line segment that connects the apex to the centroid of the base.

The lateral facets are pyramid cells, each constructed by one face of the base polyhedron and the apex. The vertices and edges of polyhedral pyramids form examples of apex graphs, graphs formed by adding one vertex (the apex) to a planar graph (the graph of the base). The dual of a polyhedral pyramid is another polyhedral pyramid, with a dual base.\nThe regular 5-cell (or 4-simplex) is an example of a tetrahedral pyramid. Uniform polyhedra with circumradii less than 1 can be make polyhedral pyramids with regular tetrahedral sides. A polyhedron with v vertices, e edges, and f faces can be the base on a polyhedral pyramid with v+1 vertices, e+v edges, f+e faces, and 1+f cells.\nA 4D polyhedral pyramid with axial symmetry can be visualized in 3D with a Schlegel diagram\u2014a 3D projection that places the apex at the center of the base polyhedron.\n\nAny convex 4-polytope can be divided into polyhedral pyramids by adding an interior point and creating one pyramid from each facet to the center point. This can be useful for computing volumes.\nThe 4-dimensional hypervolume of a polyhedral pyramid is 1/4 of the volume of the base polyhedron times its perpendicular height, compared to the area of a triangle being 1/2 the length of the base times the height and the volume of a pyramid being 1/3 the area of the base times the height.\nThe 3-dimensional surface volume of a polyhedral pyramid is \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n        V\n        =\n        B\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              3\n            \n          \n        \n        A\n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle SV=B+{\\tfrac {1}{3}}AL}\n  , where B is the base volume, A is the base surface area, and L is the slant height (height of the lateral pyramidal cells) \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              h\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              r\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle L={\\sqrt {h^{2}+r^{2}}}}\n  , where h is the height and r is the inradius.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBipyramid\nCone (geometry)\nTrigonal pyramid (chemistry)\nFrustum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Pyramid\". MathWorld.", "Secant_line": "In geometry, a secant is a line that intersects a curve at a minimum of two distinct points.\nThe word secant comes from the Latin word secare, meaning to cut. In the case of a circle, a secant intersects the circle at exactly two points. A chord is the line segment determined by the two points, that is, the interval on the secant whose ends are the two points.\n\n\n== Circles ==\n\nA straight line can intersect a circle at zero, one, or two points. A line with intersections at two points is called a secant line, at one point a tangent line and at no points an exterior line. A chord is the line segment that joins two distinct points of a  circle. A chord is therefore contained in a unique secant line and each secant line determines a unique chord.\nIn rigorous modern treatments of plane geometry, results that seem obvious and were assumed (without statement) by Euclid in his treatment, are usually proved.\nFor example, Theorem (Elementary Circular Continuity): If \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n   is a circle and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2113\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n   a line that contains a point A that is inside \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n   and a point B that is outside of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n   then \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2113\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n   is a secant line for \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n  .\nIn some situations phrasing results in terms of secant lines instead of chords can help to unify statements. As an example of this consider the result:\nIf two secant lines contain chords AB and CD in a circle and intersect at a point P that is not on the circle, then the line segment lengths satisfy AP\u22c5PB = CP\u22c5PD.If the point P lies inside the circle this is Euclid III.35, but if the point is outside the circle the result is not contained in the Elements. However, Robert Simson following Christopher Clavius demonstrated this result, sometimes called the intersecting secants theorem, in their commentaries on Euclid.\n\n\n== Curves ==\nFor curves more complicated than simple circles, the possibility that a line that intersects a curve in more than two distinct points arises. Some authors define a secant line to a curve as a line that intersects the curve in two distinct points. This definition leaves open the possibility that the line may have other points of intersection with the curve. When phrased this way the definitions of a secant line for circles and curves are identical and the possibility of additional points of intersection just does not occur for a circle.\n\n\n=== Secants and tangents ===\nSecants may be used to approximate the tangent line to a curve, at some point P, if it exists. Define a  secant to a curve by two points, P and Q, with P fixed and Q variable. As Q approaches P along the curve, if the slope of the secant approaches a limit value, then that limit defines the slope of the tangent line at P. The secant lines PQ are the approximations to the tangent line. In calculus, this idea is the geometric definition of the derivative.\n\nA tangent line to a curve at a point P may be a secant line to that curve if it intersects the curve in at least one point other than P. Another way to look at this is to realize that being a tangent line at a point P is a local property, depending only on the curve in the immediate neighborhood of P, while being a secant line is a global property since the entire domain of the function producing the curve needs to be examined.\n\n\n== Sets and n-secants ==\nThe concept of a secant line can be applied in a more general setting than Euclidean space. Let K be a finite set of k points in some geometric setting. A line will be called an n-secant of K if it contains exactly n points of K. For example, if K is a set of 50 points arranged on a circle in the Euclidean plane, a line joining two of them would be a 2-secant (or bisecant) and a line passing through only one of them would be a 1-secant (or unisecant). A unisecant in this example need not be a tangent line to the circle.\nThis terminology is often used in incidence geometry and discrete geometry. For instance, the Sylvester\u2013Gallai theorem of incidence geometry states that if n points of Euclidean geometry are not collinear then there must exist a 2-secant of them. And the original orchard-planting problem of discrete geometry asks for a bound on the number of 3-secants of a finite set of points.\nFiniteness of the set of points is not essential in this definition, as long as each line can intersect the set in only a finite number of points.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElliptic curve, a curve for which every secant has a third point of intersection, from which most of a group law may be defined\nMean value theorem, that every secant of the graph of a smooth function has a parallel tangent line\nQuadrisecant, a line that intersects four points of a curve (usually a space curve)\nSecant plane, the three-dimensional equivalent of a secant line\nSecant variety, the union of secant lines and tangent lines to a given projective variety\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Secant line\". MathWorld.", "Hexagon": "In geometry, a hexagon (from Greek \u1f15\u03be, hex, meaning \"six\", and \u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, gon\u00eda, meaning \"corner, angle\") is a six-sided polygon. The total of the internal angles of any simple (non-self-intersecting) hexagon is 720\u00b0.\n\n\n== Regular hexagon ==\nA regular hexagon has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {6} and can also be constructed as a truncated equilateral triangle, t{3}, which alternates two types of edges.\n\nA regular hexagon is defined as a hexagon that is both equilateral and equiangular. It is bicentric, meaning that it is both cyclic (has a circumscribed circle) and tangential (has an inscribed circle).\nThe common length of the sides equals the radius of the circumscribed circle or circumcircle, which equals \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              \n                3\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {2}{\\sqrt {3}}}}\n   times the apothem (radius of the inscribed circle). All internal angles are 120 degrees. A regular hexagon has six rotational symmetries (rotational symmetry of order six) and six reflection symmetries (six lines of symmetry), making up the dihedral group D6. The longest diagonals of a regular hexagon, connecting diametrically opposite vertices, are twice the length of one side. From this it can be seen that a triangle with a vertex at the center of the regular hexagon and sharing one side with the hexagon is equilateral, and that the regular hexagon can be partitioned into six equilateral triangles.\nLike squares and equilateral triangles, regular hexagons fit together without any gaps to tile the plane (three hexagons meeting at every vertex), and so are useful for constructing tessellations. The cells of a beehive honeycomb are hexagonal for this reason and because the shape makes efficient use of space and building materials. The Voronoi diagram of a regular triangular lattice is the honeycomb tessellation of hexagons. It is not usually considered a triambus, although it is equilateral.\n\n\n== Parameters ==\n\nThe maximal diameter (which corresponds to the long diagonal of the hexagon), D, is twice the maximal radius or circumradius, R, which equals the side length, t. The minimal diameter or the diameter of the inscribed circle (separation of parallel sides, flat-to-flat distance, short diagonal or height when resting on a flat base), d, is twice the minimal radius or inradius, r. The maxima and minima are related by the same factor:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        d\n        =\n        r\n        =\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          30\n          \n            \u2218\n          \n        \n        )\n        R\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        R\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}d=r=\\cos(30^{\\circ })R={\\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{2}}R={\\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{2}}t}\n     and, similarly, \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        D\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d={\\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{2}}D.}\n  The area of a regular hexagon\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      3\n                      \n                        \n                          3\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  R\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                =\n                3\n                R\n                r\n                =\n                2\n                \n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                \n                \n                  r\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      3\n                      \n                        \n                          3\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    8\n                  \n                \n                \n                  D\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    3\n                    4\n                  \n                \n                D\n                d\n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      3\n                    \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  d\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                \u2248\n                2.598\n                \n                  R\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2248\n                3.464\n                \n                  r\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                \u2248\n                0.6495\n                \n                  D\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \u2248\n                0.866\n                \n                  d\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                .\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}A&={\\frac {3{\\sqrt {3}}}{2}}R^{2}=3Rr=2{\\sqrt {3}}r^{2}\\\\[3pt]&={\\frac {3{\\sqrt {3}}}{8}}D^{2}={\\frac {3}{4}}Dd={\\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{2}}d^{2}\\\\[3pt]&\\approx 2.598R^{2}\\approx 3.464r^{2}\\\\&\\approx 0.6495D^{2}\\approx 0.866d^{2}.\\end{aligned}}}\n  For any regular polygon, the area can also be expressed in terms of the apothem a and the perimeter p.

hexagon has D6 symmetry. There are 16 subgroups. There are 8 up to isomorphism: itself (D6), 2 dihedral: (D3, D2), 4 cyclic: (Z6, Z3, Z2, Z1) and the trivial (e)\nThese symmetries express nine distinct symmetries of a regular hexagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. r12 is full symmetry, and a1 is no symmetry. p6, an isogonal hexagon constructed by three mirrors can alternate long and short edges, and d6, an isotoxal hexagon constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular hexagon. The i4 forms are regular hexagons flattened or stretched along one symmetry direction. It can be seen as an elongated rhombus, while d2 and p2 can be seen as horizontally and vertically elongated kites. g2 hexagons, with opposite sides parallel are also called hexagonal parallelogons.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g6 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.\nHexagons of symmetry g2, i4, and r12, as parallelogons can tessellate the Euclidean plane by translation. Other hexagon shapes can tile the plane with different orientations.\n\n\n=== A2 and G2 groups ===\nThe 6 roots of the simple Lie group A2, represented by a Dynkin diagram , are in a regular hexagonal pattern. The two simple roots have a 120\u00b0 angle between them.\nThe 12 roots of the Exceptional Lie group G2, represented by a Dynkin diagram  are also in a hexagonal pattern. The two simple roots of two lengths have a 150\u00b0 angle between them.\n\n\n== Dissection ==\nCoxeter states that every zonogon (a 2m-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into 1\u20442m(m \u2212 1) parallelograms. In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. This decomposition of a regular hexagon is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a cube, with 3 of 6 square faces. Other parallelogons and projective directions of the cube are dissected within rectangular cuboids.\n\n\n== Related polygons and tilings ==\nA regular hexagon has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {6}. A regular hexagon is a part of the regular hexagonal tiling, {6,3}, with three hexagonal faces around each vertex.\nA regular hexagon can also be created as a truncated equilateral triangle, with Schl\u00e4fli symbol t{3}. Seen with two types (colors) of edges, this form only has D3 symmetry.\nA truncated hexagon, t{6}, is a dodecagon, {12}, alternating two types (colors) of edges. An alternated hexagon, h{6}, is an equilateral triangle, {3}. A regular hexagon can be stellated with equilateral triangles on its edges, creating a hexagram. A regular hexagon can be dissected into six equilateral triangles by adding a center point. This pattern repeats within the regular triangular tiling.\nA regular hexagon can be extended into a regular dodecagon by adding alternating squares and equilateral triangles around it. This pattern repeats within the rhombitrihexagonal tiling.\n\n\n=== Self-crossing hexagons ===\nThere are six self-crossing hexagons with the vertex arrangement of the regular hexagon:\n\n\n== Hexagonal structures ==\n\nFrom bees' honeycombs to the Giant's Causeway, hexagonal patterns are prevalent in nature due to their efficiency. In a hexagonal grid each line is as short as it can possibly be if a large area is to be filled with the fewest hexagons. This means that honeycombs require less wax to construct and gain much strength under compression.\nIrregular hexagons with parallel opposite edges are called parallelogons and can also tile the plane by translation. In three dimensions, hexagonal prisms with parallel opposite faces are called parallelohedrons and these can tessellate 3-space by translation.\n\n\n== Tesselations by hexagons ==\n\nIn addition to the regular hexagon, which determines a unique tessellation of the plane, any irregular hexagon which satisfies the Conway criterion will tile the plane.\n\n\n== Hexagon inscribed in a conic section ==\nPascal's theorem (also known as the \"Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem\") states that if an arbitrary hexagon is inscribed in any conic section, and pairs of opposite sides are extended until they meet, the three intersection points will lie on a straight line, the \"Pascal line\" of that configuration.\n\n\n=== Cyclic hexagon ===\nThe Lemoine hexagon is a cyclic hexagon (one inscribed in a circle) with vertices given by the six intersections of the edges of a triangle and the three lines that are parallel to the edges that pass through its symmedian point.\nIf the successive sides of a cyclic hexagon are a, b, c, d, e, f, then the three main diagonals intersect in a single point if and only if ace = bdf.If, for each side of a cyclic hexagon, the adjacent sides are extended to their intersection, forming a triangle exterior to the given side, then the segments connecting the circumcenters of opposite triangles are concurrent.If a hexagon has vertices on the circumcircle of an acute triangle at the six points (including three triangle vertices) where the extended altitudes of the triangle meet the circumcircle, then the area of the hexagon is twice the area of the triangle.:\u200ap. 179\u200a\n\n\n== Hexagon tangential to a conic section ==\nLet ABCDEF be a hexagon formed by six tangent lines of a conic section. Then Brianchon's theorem states that the three main diagonals AD, BE, and CF intersect at a single point.\nIn a hexagon that is tangential to a circle and that has consecutive sides a, b, c, d, e, and f,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        +\n        c\n        +\n        e\n        =\n        b\n        +\n        d\n        +\n        f\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a+c+e=b+d+f.}\n  \n\n\n== Equilateral triangles on the sides of an arbitrary hexagon ==\n\nIf an equilateral triangle is constructed externally on each side of any hexagon, then the midpoints of the segments connecting the centroids of opposite triangles form another equilateral triangle.:\u200aThm. 1\u200a\n\n\n== Skew hexagon ==\n\nA skew hexagon is a skew polygon with six vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such a hexagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag hexagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew hexagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In three dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew hexagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a triangular antiprism with the same D3d, [2+,6] symmetry, order 12.\nThe cube and octahedron (same as triangular antiprism) have regular skew hexagons as petrie polygons.\n\n\n=== Petrie polygons ===\nThe regular skew hexagon is the Petrie polygon for these higher dimensional regular, uniform and dual polyhedra and polytopes, shown in these skew orthogonal projections:\n\n\n== Convex equilateral hexagon ==\nA principal diagonal of a hexagon is a diagonal which divides the hexagon into quadrilaterals.

Euclid's approach consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms (postulates) and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated earlier, Euclid was the first to organize these propositions into a logical system in which each result is proved from axioms and previously proved theorems.The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of mathematical proofs. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.For more than two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  gravitational field).Euclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects. This is in contrast to analytic geometry, introduced almost 2,000 years later by Ren\u00e9 Descartes, which uses coordinates to express geometric properties as algebraic formulas.\n\n\n== The Elements ==\n\nThe Elements is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\nThere are 13 books in the Elements:\nBooks I\u2013IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example, \"In any triangle, two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.\" (Book I proposition 17) and the Pythagorean theorem \"In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.\" (Book I, proposition 47)\nBooks V and VII\u2013X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of surface regions. Notions such as prime numbers and rational and irrational numbers are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\nBooks XI\u2013XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The platonic solids are constructed.\n\n\n=== Axioms ===\n\nEuclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems (\"true statements\") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of non-Euclidean geometry, these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.Near the beginning of the first book of the Elements, Euclid gives five postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):\nLet the following be postulated:To draw a straight line from any point to any point.\nTo produce (extend) a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.\nTo describe a circle with any centre and distance (radius).\nThat all right angles are equal to one another.\n[The parallel postulate]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.Although Euclid explicitly only asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning he also implicitly assumes them to be unique.\nThe Elements also include the following five \"common notions\":\n\nThings that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the transitive property of a Euclidean relation).\nIf equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).\nIf equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (subtraction property of equality).\nThings that coincide with one another are equal to one another (reflexive property).\nThe whole is greater than the part.Modern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation. Modern treatments use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.\n\n\n=== Parallel postulate ===\n\nTo the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them, it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.\nMany alternative axioms can be formulated which are logically equivalent to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, Playfair's axiom states:\n\nIn a plane, through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.The \"at most\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists.\n\n\n=== Methods of proof ===\nEuclidean Geometry is constructive. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a compass and an unmarked straightedge. In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as set theory, which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are models of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider nonconstructive methods just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones\u2014e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as \"Find the greatest common measure of ...\"Euclid often used proof by contradiction. Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.\n\n\n== Notation and terminology ==\n\n\n=== Naming of points and figures ===\nPoints are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.\n\n\n=== Complementary and supplementary angles ===\nAngles whose sum is a right angle are called complementary. Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\nAngles whose sum is a straight angle are supplementary. Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\n\n=== Modern versions of Euclid's notation ===\nIn modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in degrees or radians.\nModern school textbooks often define separate figures called lines (infinite), rays (semi-infinite), and line segments (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as \"if the line is extended to a sufficient length\", although he occasionally referred to \"infinite lines\". A \"line\" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term \"straight line\" when necessary.\n\n\n== Some important or well known results ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pons asinorum ===\nThe pons asinorum (bridge of asses) states that in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.\n\n\n=== Congruence of triangles ===\n\nTriangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.\n\n\n=== Triangle angle sum ===\nThe sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees). This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one obtuse or right angle.\n\n\n=== Pythagorean theorem ===\nThe celebrated Pythagorean theorem (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).\n\n\n=== Thales' theorem ===\nThales' theorem, named after Thales of Miletus states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Cantor supposed that Thales proved his theorem by means of Euclid Book I, Prop. 32 after the manner of Euclid Book III, Prop. 31.\n\n\n=== Scaling of area and volume ===\nIn modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions, \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \u221d\n        \n          L\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\propto L^{2}}\n  , and the volume of a solid to the cube, \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        \u221d\n        \n          L\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V\\propto L^{3}}\n  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid. Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor Archimedes who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.\n\n\n== System of measurement and arithmetic ==\nEuclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, for example, a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.\nMeasurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, for example in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.\n\nEuclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as \"equal\" (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal respectively, and similarly for angles. The stronger term \"congruent\" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as similar. Corresponding angles in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and corresponding sides are in proportion to each other.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nBecause of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nAs suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in and also one of the most common current use of geometry is surveying, and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains, such as Gunter's chain, and angles using graduated circles and, later, the theodolite.\nAn application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient packing of spheres in n dimensions. This problem has applications in error detection and correction.\nGeometric optics uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nGeometry is used extensively in architecture.\nGeometry can be used to design origami. Some classical construction problems of geometry are impossible using compass and straightedge, but can be solved using origami.Much of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) is based on Euclidean geometry. Design geometry typically consists of shapes bounded by planes, cylinders, cones, tori, and other similar shapes. In the present day, CAD/CAM is essential in the design of almost everything, including cars, airplanes, ships, and smartphones. A few decades ago, sophisticated draftsmen would learn fairly advanced Euclidean geometry, including things like Pascal's theorem and Brianchon's theorem, but in modern times this is no longer necessary.\n\n\n== Later history ==\n\n\n=== Archimedes and Apollonius ===\n\nArchimedes (c. 287 BCE \u2013 c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original. He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the Archimedean property of finite numbers.\nApollonius of Perga (c. 262 BCE \u2013 c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.\n\n\n=== 17th century: Descartes ===\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) developed analytic geometry, an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.In this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its Cartesian (x, y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.\nIn Euclid's original approach, the Pythagorean theorem follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.\nThe equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        P\n        Q\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              p\n              \n                x\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            \n              q\n              \n                x\n              \n            \n            \n              )\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            (\n            \n              p\n              \n                y\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            \n              q\n              \n                y\n              \n            \n            \n              )\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |PQ|={\\sqrt {(p_{x}-q_{x})^{2}+(p_{y}-q_{y})^{2}}}\\,}\n  defining the distance between two points P = (px, py) and Q = (qx, qy) is then known as the Euclidean metric, and other metrics define non-Euclidean geometries.\nIn terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y = 2x + 1 (a line), or x2 + y2 = 7 (a circle).\nAlso in the 17th century, Girard Desargues, motivated by the theory of perspective, introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, projective geometry, but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nGeometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of trisecting an angle with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until Pierre Wantzel published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include doubling the cube and squaring the circle. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.\nEuler discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called affine geometry, which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn the early 19th century, Carnot and M\u00f6bius systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.\n\n\n==== Higher dimensions ====\nIn the 1840s William Rowan Hamilton developed the quaternions, and John T. Graves and Arthur Cayley the octonions. These are normed algebras which extend the complex numbers. Later it was understood that the quaternions are also a Euclidean geometric system with four real Cartesian coordinates. Cayley used quaternions to study rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.At mid-century Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli developed the general concept of Euclidean space, extending Euclidean geometry to higher dimensions. He defined polyschemes, later called polytopes, which are the higher-dimensional analogues of polygons and polyhedra. He developed their theory and discovered all the regular polytopes, i.e. the \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  -dimensional analogues of regular polygons and Platonic solids. He found there are six regular convex polytopes in dimension four, and three in all higher dimensions.\n\nSchl\u00e4fli performed this work in relative obscurity and it was published in full only posthumously in 1901. It had little influence until it was rediscovered and fully documented in 1948 by H.S.M. Coxeter.\nIn 1878 William Kingdon Clifford introduced what is now termed geometric algebra, unifying Hamilton's quaternions with Hermann Grassmann's algebra and revealing the geometric nature of these systems, especially in four dimensions. The operations of geometric algebra have the effect of mirroring, rotating, translating, and mapping the geometric objects that are being modeled to new positions. The Clifford torus on the surface of the 3-sphere is the simplest and most symmetric flat embedding of the Cartesian product of two circles (in the same sense that the surface of a cylinder is \"flat\").\n\n\n==== Non-Euclidean geometry ====\n\nThe century's most influential development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, J\u00e1nos Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published work on non-Euclidean geometry, in which the parallel postulate is not valid. Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.\nIn the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the Elements. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the Elements, shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third vertex. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the completeness property of the real numbers. Starting with Moritz Pasch in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of Hilbert, George Birkhoff, and Tarski.\n\n\n=== 20th century and relativity ===\n\nEinstein's theory of special relativity involves a four-dimensional space-time, the Minkowski space, which is non-Euclidean. This shows that non-Euclidean geometries, which had been introduced a few years earlier for showing that the parallel postulate cannot be proved, are also useful for describing the physical world.\nHowever, the three-dimensional \"space part\" of the Minkowski space remains the space of Euclidean geometry. This is not the case with general relativity, for which the geometry of the space part of space-time is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the Sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting these deviations in rays of light from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the GPS system.\n\n\n== As a description of the structure of space ==\nEuclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Euclid's proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious in Euclid's fundamental axioms, in particular that certain movements of figures do not change their geometrical properties such as the lengths of sides and interior angles, the so-called Euclidean motions, which include translations, reflections and rotations of figures. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries; postulate 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is isotropic and figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and postulate 5 (the parallel postulate) that space is flat (has no intrinsic curvature).As discussed above, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity significantly modifies this view.\nThe ambiguous character of the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid makes it possible for different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether or not it is infinite (see below) and what its topology is. Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1\u20134 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in elliptic geometry), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a torus for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).\n\n\n== Treatment of infinity ==\n\n\n=== Infinite objects ===\nEuclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between \"finite lines\" (e.g., Postulate 2) and \"infinite lines\" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.The notion of infinitesimal quantities had previously been discussed extensively by the Eleatic School, but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as Zeno's paradox occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the method of exhaustion rather than infinitesimals.Later ancient commentators, such as Proclus (410\u2013485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.At the turn of the 20th century, Otto Stolz, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Giuseppe Veronese, and others produced controversial work on non-Archimedean models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the Newton\u2013Leibniz sense. Fifty years later, Abraham Robinson provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work.\n\n\n=== Infinite processes ===\nAncient geometers may have considered the parallel postulate \u2013 that two parallel lines do not ever intersect \u2013 less certain than the others because it makes a statement about infinitely remote regions of space, and so cannot be physically verified.The modern formulation of proof by induction was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.Supposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as Zeno's paradox, predated Euclid. Euclid avoided such discussions, giving, for example, the expression for the partial sums of the geometric series in IX.35 without commenting on the possibility of letting the number of terms become infinite.\n\n\n== Logical basis ==\n\n\n=== Classical logic ===\nEuclid frequently used the method of proof by contradiction, and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes classical logic, in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition \"P or not P\" is automatically true.\n\n\n=== Modern standards of rigor ===\nPlacing Euclidean geometry on a solid axiomatic basis was a preoccupation of mathematicians for centuries. The role of primitive notions, or undefined concepts, was clearly put forward by Alessandro Padoa of the Peano delegation at the 1900 Paris conference: ...when we begin to formulate the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are completely devoid of meaning and that the unproved propositions are simply conditions imposed upon the undefined symbols.\nThen, the system of ideas that we have initially chosen is simply one interpretation of the undefined symbols; but..this interpretation can be ignored by the reader, who is free to replace it in his mind by another interpretation.. that satisfies the conditions...\nLogical questions thus become completely independent of empirical or psychological questions...\n\nThe system of undefined symbols can then be regarded as the abstraction obtained from the specialized theories that result when...the system of undefined symbols is successively replaced by each of the interpretations...\nThat is, mathematics is context-independent knowledge within a hierarchical framework. As said by Bertrand Russell:\nIf our hypothesis is about anything, and not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions constitute mathematics. Thus, mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.\nSuch foundational approaches range between foundationalism and formalism.\n\n\n=== Axiomatic formulations ===\nGeometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures.\nEuclid's axioms: In his dissertation to Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand Russell summarized the changing role of Euclid's geometry in the minds of philosophers up to that time. It was a conflict between certain knowledge, independent of experiment, and empiricism, requiring experimental input. This issue became clear as it was discovered that the parallel postulate was not necessarily valid and its applicability was an empirical matter, deciding whether the applicable geometry was Euclidean or non-Euclidean.\nHilbert's axioms: Hilbert's axioms had the goal of identifying a simple and complete set of independent axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could be deduced. The outstanding objectives were to make Euclidean geometry rigorous (avoiding hidden assumptions) and to make clear the ramifications of the parallel postulate.\nBirkhoff's axioms: Birkhoff proposed four postulates for Euclidean geometry that can be confirmed experimentally with scale and protractor. This system relies heavily on the properties of the real numbers. The notions of angle and distance become primitive concepts.\nTarski's axioms: Alfred Tarski (1902\u20131983) and his students defined elementary Euclidean geometry as the geometry that can be expressed in first-order logic and does not depend on set theory for its logical basis, in contrast to Hilbert's axioms, which involve point sets. Tarski proved that his axiomatic formulation of elementary Euclidean geometry is consistent and complete in a certain sense: there is an algorithm that, for every proposition, can be shown either true or false. (This doesn't violate G\u00f6del's theorem, because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of arithmetic for the theorem to apply.) This is equivalent to the decidability of real closed fields, of which elementary Euclidean geometry is a model.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbsolute geometry\nAnalytic geometry\nBirkhoff's axioms\nCartesian coordinate system\nHilbert's axioms\nIncidence geometry\nList of interactive geometry software\nMetric space\nNon-Euclidean geometry\nOrdered geometry\nParallel postulate\nType theory\n\n\n=== Classical theorems ===\nAngle bisector theorem\nButterfly theorem\nCeva's theorem\nHeron's formula\nMenelaus' theorem\nNine-point circle\nPythagorean theorem\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBall, W.

In mathematics, tessellation can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of geometries.\nA periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of the same shape, and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called \"non-periodic\". An aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. A tessellation of space, also known as a space filling or honeycomb, can be defined in the geometry of higher dimensions.\nA real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor, or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art such as in the Moroccan architecture and decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTessellations were used by the Sumerians (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.Decorative mosaic tilings made of small squared blocks called tesserae were widely employed in classical antiquity, sometimes displaying geometric patterns.In 1619, Johannes Kepler made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his Harmonices Mundi; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.\n\nSome two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer Yevgraf Fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen different groups of isometries. Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Alexei Vasilievich Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov (1964), and Heinrich Heesch and Otto Kienzle (1963).\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn Latin, tessella is a small cubical piece of clay, stone, or glass used to make mosaics. The word \"tessella\" means \"small square\" (from tessera, square, which in turn is from the Greek word \u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 for four). It corresponds to the everyday term tiling, which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of glazed clay.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nTessellation in two dimensions, also called planar tiling, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square and the regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.Many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.\n\nMore formally, a tessellation or tiling is a cover of the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called tiles, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient, but not necessary, set of rules for deciding whether a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion, but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining whether a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.Mathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schl\u00e4fli symbol notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schl\u00e4fli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schl\u00e4fli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is {6,3}.Other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the vertex configuration, which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.\n\n\n== In mathematics ==\n\n\n=== Introduction to tessellations ===\n\nMathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A vertex is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.The sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An edge-to-edge tiling is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tiling, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar \"brick wall\" tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.A normal tiling is a tessellation for which every tile is topologically equivalent to a disk, the intersection of any two tiles is a connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.\n\nA monohedral tiling is a tessellation in which all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, 3\u03c0/5, is not a divisor of 2\u03c0.An isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling. If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms anisohedral tilings.\nA regular tessellation is a highly symmetric, edge-to-edge tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.\n\nA semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.\n\n\n=== Wallpaper groups ===\n\nTilings with translational symmetry in two independent directions can be categorized by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Although this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have interested modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m wallpaper group and one is in p4m. Tilings in 2-D with translational symmetry in just one direction may be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation can be used to describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.\n\n\n=== Aperiodic tilings ===\n\nPenrose tilings, which use two different quadrilateral prototiles, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this way is the rep-tiles; these tilings have unexpected self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.\n\nWang tiles are squares coloured on each edge, and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have the same colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented as a set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane if, and only if, the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.\n\nTruchet tiles are square tiles decorated with patterns so they do not have rotational symmetry; in 1704, S\u00e9bastien Truchet used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or randomly.An Einstein tile is a single shape that forces aperiodic tiling. The first such tile, dubbed a \"hat\", was discovered in 2023 by David Smith, a hobbyist mathematician. The discovery is under professional review and, upon confirmation, will be credited as solving a longstanding mathematical problem.\n\n\n=== Tessellations and colour ===\n\nSometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity, one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape, but different colours, are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring that does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as demonstrated in the image at right.\n\n\n=== Tessellations with polygons ===\n\nNext to the various tilings by regular polygons, tilings by other polygons have also been studied.\nAny triangle or quadrilateral (even non-convex) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.If only one shape of tile is allowed, tilings exists with convex N-gons for N equal to 3, 4, 5, and 6. For N = 5, see Pentagonal tiling, for N = 6, see Hexagonal tiling, for N = 7, see Heptagonal tiling and for N = 8, see octagonal tiling.\nFor results on tiling the plane with polyominoes, see Polyomino \u00a7 Uses of polyominoes.\n\n\n=== Voronoi tilings ===\nVoronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as the set of points closest to one of the points in a discrete set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The Voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.\n\n\n=== Tessellations in higher dimensions ===\n\nTessellation can be extended to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion is known as a plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.\n\nTessellations in three or more dimensions are called honeycombs. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform honeycombs can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.The Schmitt-Conway biprism is a convex polyhedron with the property of tiling space only aperiodically.A Schwarz triangle is a spherical triangle that can be used to tile a sphere.\n\n\n=== Tessellations in non-Euclidean geometries ===\n\nIt is possible to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (that may be regular, quasiregular, or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).A uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space is a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells. In three-dimensional (3-D) hyperbolic space there are nine Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.\n\n\n== In art ==\n\nIn architecture, tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times. Mosaic tilings often had geometric patterns. Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most decorative were the Moorish wall tilings of Islamic architecture, using Girih and Zellige tiles in buildings such as the Alhambra and La Mezquita.Tessellations frequently appeared in the graphic art of M. C. Escher; he was inspired by the Moorish use of symmetry in places such as the Alhambra when he visited Spain in 1936. Escher made four \"Circle Limit\" drawings of tilings that use hyperbolic geometry. For his woodcut \"Circle Limit IV\" (1960), Escher prepared a pencil and ink study showing the required geometry. Escher explained that \"No single component of all the series, which from infinitely far away rise like rockets perpendicularly from the limit and are at last lost in it, ever reaches the boundary line.\"\n\nTessellated designs often appear on textiles, whether woven, stitched in, or printed. Tessellation patterns have been used to design interlocking motifs of patch shapes in quilts.Tessellations are also a main genre in origami (paper folding), where pleats are used to connect molecules, such as twist folds, together in a repeating fashion.\n\n\n== In manufacturing ==\nTessellation is used in manufacturing industry to reduce the wastage of material (yield losses) such as sheet metal when cutting out shapes for objects such as car doors or drink cans.Tessellation is apparent in the mudcrack-like cracking of thin films \u2013 with a degree of self-organisation being observed using micro and nanotechnologies.\n\n\n== In nature ==\n\nThe honeycomb is a well-known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells.\n\nIn botany, the term \"tessellate\" describes a checkered pattern, for example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the fritillary, and some species of Colchicum, are characteristically tessellate.Many patterns in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns can be described by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model for the formation of mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from being randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.Other natural patterns occur in foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire\u2013Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.\n\n\n== In puzzles and recreational mathematics ==\n\nTessellations have given rise to many types of tiling puzzle, from traditional jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram, to more modern puzzles that often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the \"rep-tile\", a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. Inspired by Gardner's articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. Squaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square (one whose sides have integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is squaring the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nDiscrete global grid\nSpace partitioning\nHoneycomb (geometry)\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCoxeter, H.S.M.

In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. \"two counties over\").  Since spatial cognition is a rich source of conceptual metaphors in human thought, the term is also frequently used metaphorically to mean a measurement of the amount of difference between two similar objects (such as statistical distance between probability distributions or edit distance between strings of text) or a degree of separation (as exemplified by distance between people in a social network).  Most such notions of distance, both physical and metaphorical, are formalized in mathematics using the notion of a metric space.\nIn the social sciences, distance can refer to a qualitative measurement of separation, such as social distance or psychological distance.\n\n\n== Distances in physics and geometry ==\nThe distance between physical locations can be defined in different ways in different contexts.\n\n\n=== Straight-line or Euclidean distance ===\n\nThe distance between two points in physical space is the length of a straight line between them, which is the shortest possible path.  This is the usual meaning of distance in classical physics, including Newtonian mechanics. \nStraight-line distance is formalized mathematically as the Euclidean distance in two- and three-dimensional space.  In Euclidean geometry, the distance between two points A and B is often denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        A\n        B\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |AB|}\n  .  In coordinate geometry, Euclidean distance is computed using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the plane is given by:\nSimilarly, given points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in three-dimensional space, the distance between them is:\nThis idea generalizes to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces.\n\n\n==== Measurement ====\n\nThere are many ways of measuring straight-line distances. For example, it can be done directly using a ruler, or indirectly with a radar (for long distances) or interferometry (for very short distances).  The cosmic distance ladder is a set of ways of measuring extremely long distances.\n\n\n=== Shortest-path distance on a curved surface ===\n\nThe straight-line distance between two points on the surface of the Earth is not very useful for most purposes, since we cannot tunnel straight through the Earth's mantle.  Instead, one typically measures the shortest path along the surface of the Earth, as the crow flies.  This is approximated mathematically by the great-circle distance on a sphere.\nMore generally, the shortest path between two points along a curved surface is known as a geodesic.  The arc length of geodesics gives a way of measuring distance from the perspective of an ant or other flightless creature living on that surface.\n\n\n=== Effects of relativity ===\n\nIn the theory of relativity, because of phenomena such as length contraction and the relativity of simultaneity, distances between objects depend on a choice of inertial frame of reference.  On galactic and larger scales, the measurement of distance is also affected by the expansion of the universe.  In practice, a number of distance measures are used in cosmology to quantify such distances.\n\n\n=== Other spatial distances ===\n\nUnusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations, but are also used in theoretical mathematics:\n\nIn practice, one is often interested in the travel distance between two points along roads, rather than as the crow flies.  In a grid plan, the travel distance between street corners is given by the Manhattan distance: the number of east\u2013west and north\u2013south blocks one must traverse to get between those two points.\nChessboard distance, formalized as Chebyshev distance, is the minimum number of moves a king must make on a chessboard in order to travel between two squares.\n\n\n== Metaphorical distances ==\nMany abstract notions of distance used in mathematics, science and engineering represent a degree of difference or separation between similar objects.  This page gives a few examples.\n\n\n=== Statistical distances ===\n\nIn statistics and information geometry, statistical distances measure the degree of difference between two probability distributions.  There are many kinds of statistical distances, typically formalized as divergences; these allow a set of probability distributions to be understood as a geometrical object called a statistical manifold.  The most elementary is the squared Euclidean distance, which is minimized by the least squares method; this is the most basic Bregman divergence. The most important in information theory is the relative entropy (Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence), which allows one to analogously study maximum likelihood estimation geometrically; this is an example of both an f-divergence and a Bregman divergence (and in fact the only example which is both). Statistical manifolds corresponding to Bregman divergences are flat manifolds in the corresponding geometry, allowing an analog of the Pythagorean theorem (which holds for squared Euclidean distance) to be used for linear inverse problems in inference by optimization theory.\nOther important statistical distances include the Mahalanobis distance and the energy distance.\n\n\n=== Edit distances ===\nIn computer science, an edit distance or string metric between two strings measures how different they are. For example, the words \"dog\" and \"dot\", which differ by just one letter, are closer than \"dog\" and \"cat\", which have no letters in common.  This idea is used in spell checkers and in coding theory, and is mathematically formalized in a number of different ways, including Levenshtein distance, Hamming distance, Lee distance, and Jaro\u2013Winkler distance.\n\n\n=== Distance in graph theory ===\n\nIn a graph, the distance between two vertices is measured by the length of the shortest edge path between them.  For example, if the graph represents a social network, then the idea of six degrees of separation can be interpreted mathematically as saying that the distance between any two vertices is at most six.  Similarly, the Erd\u0151s number and the Bacon number\u2014the number of collaborative relationships away a person is from prolific mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s and actor Kevin Bacon, respectively\u2014are distances in the graphs whose edges represent mathematical or artistic collaborations.\n\n\n=== In the social sciences ===\nIn psychology, human geography, and the social sciences, distance is often theorized not as an objective numerical measurement, but as a qualitative description of a subjective experience.  For example, psychological distance is \"the different ways in which an object might be removed from\" the self along dimensions such as \"time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality\".  In sociology, social distance describes the separation between individuals or social groups in society along dimensions such as social class, race/ethnicity, gender or sexuality.\n\n\n== Mathematical formalization ==\n\nMost of the notions of distance between two points or objects described above are examples of the mathematical idea of a metric.  A metric or distance function is a function d which takes pairs of points or objects to real numbers and satisfies the following rules:\n\nThe distance between an object and itself is always zero.\nThe distance between distinct objects is always positive.\nDistance is symmetric: the distance from x to y is always the same as the distance from y to x.\nDistance satisfies the triangle inequality: if x, y, and z are three objects, then  This condition can be described informally as \"intermediate stops can't speed you up.\"As an exception, many of the divergences used in statistics are not metrics.\n\n\n== Distance between sets ==\n\nThere are multiple ways of measuring the physical distance between objects that consist of more than one point:\n\nOne may measure the distance between representative points such as the center of mass; this is used for astronomical distances such as the Earth\u2013Moon distance.\nOne may measure the distance between the closest points of the two objects; in this sense, the altitude of an airplane or spacecraft is its distance from the Earth.  The same sense of distance is used in Euclidean geometry to define distance from a point to a line, distance from a point to a plane, or, more generally, perpendicular distance between affine subspaces.Even more generally, this idea can be used to define the distance between two subsets of a metric space.  The distance between sets A and B is the infimum of the distances between any two of their respective points: This does not define a metric on the set of such subsets: the distance between overlapping sets is zero, and this distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality for any metric space with two or more points (consider the triple of sets consisting of two distinct singletons and their union).The Hausdorff distance between two subsets of a metric space can be thought of as measuring how far they are from perfectly overlapping.  Somewhat more precisely, the Hausdorff distance between A and B is either the distance from A to the farthest point of B, or the distance from B to the farthest point of A, whichever is larger.  (Here \"farthest point\" must be interpreted as a supremum.)  The Hausdorff distance defines a metric on the set of compact subsets of a metric space.\n\n\n== Related ideas ==\n\nThe word distance is also used for related concepts that are not encompassed by the description \"a numerical measurement of how far apart points or objects are\".\n\n\n=== Distance travelled ===\nThe distance travelled by an object is the length of a specific path travelled between two points, such as the distance walked while navigating a maze.  This can even be a closed distance along a closed curve which starts and ends at the same point, such as a ball thrown straight up, or the Earth when it completes one orbit.  This is formalized mathematically as the arc length of the curve.\nThe distance travelled may also be signed: a \"forward\" distance is positive and a \"backward\" distance is negative.\nCircular distance is the distance traveled by a point on the circumference of a wheel, which can be useful to consider when designing vehicles or mechanical gears (see also odometry). The circumference of the wheel is 2\u03c0 \u00d7 radius; if the radius is 1, each revolution of the wheel causes a vehicle to travel 2\u03c0 radians.\n\n\n=== Displacement and directed distance ===\n\nThe displacement in classical physics measures the change in position of an object during an interval of time.  While distance is a scalar quantity, or a magnitude, displacement is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction.  In general, the vector measuring the difference between two locations (the relative position) is sometimes called the directed distance.  For example, the directed distance from the New York City Main Library flag pole to the Statue of Liberty flag pole has: \n\nA starting point: library flag pole\nAn ending point: statue flag pole\nA direction: -38\u00b0\nA distance: 8.72 km\n\n\n=== Signed distance ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Library support ==\nPython (programming language)\nInterspace -A package for finding the distance between two vectors, numbers and strings.\nSciPy -Distance computations (scipy.spatial.distance)\nJulia (programming language)\nJulia Statistics Distance -A Julia package for evaluating distances (metrics) between vectors.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDeza E, Deza M (2006). Dictionary of Distances. Elsevier. ISBN 0-444-52087-2.", "Cone": "A cone is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex.\nA cone is formed by a set of line segments, half-lines, or  lines connecting a common point, the apex, to all of the points on a base that is in a plane that does not contain the apex. Depending on the author, the base may be restricted to be a circle, any one-dimensional quadratic form in the plane, any closed one-dimensional figure, or any of the above plus all the enclosed points. If the enclosed points are included in the base, the cone is a solid object; otherwise it is a two-dimensional object in three-dimensional space. In the case of a solid object, the boundary formed by these lines or partial lines is called the lateral surface; if the lateral surface is unbounded, it is a conical surface.\nIn the case of line segments, the cone does not extend beyond the base, while in the case of half-lines, it extends infinitely far. In the case of lines, the cone extends infinitely far in both directions from the apex, in which case it is sometimes called a double cone.  Either half of a double cone on one side of the apex is called a nappe.\nThe axis of a cone is the straight line (if any), passing through the apex, about which the base (and the whole cone) has a circular symmetry. \nIn common usage in elementary geometry, cones are assumed to be right circular, where circular means that the base is a circle and right means that the axis passes through the centre of the base at right angles to its plane. If the cone is right circular the intersection of a plane with the lateral surface is a conic section. In general, however, the base may be any shape and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is usually assumed that the base is bounded and therefore has finite area, and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base). Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the axis passes through the centre of the base non-perpendicularly.A cone with a polygonal base is called a pyramid.\nDepending on the context, \"cone\" may also mean specifically a convex cone or a projective cone.\nCones can also be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n\n== Further terminology ==\nThe perimeter of the base of a cone is called the \"directrix\", and each of the line segments between the directrix and apex is a \"generatrix\" or \"generating line\" of the lateral surface.  (For the connection between this sense of the term \"directrix\" and the directrix of a conic section, see Dandelin spheres.)\nThe \"base radius\" of a circular cone is the radius of its base; often this is simply called the radius of the cone. The aperture of a right circular cone is the maximum angle between two generatrix lines; if the generatrix makes an angle \u03b8 to the axis, the aperture is 2\u03b8. In optics, the angle \u03b8 is called the half-angle of the cone, to distinguish it from the aperture.\n\nA cone with a region including its apex cut off by a plane is called a \"truncated cone\"; if the truncation plane is parallel to the cone's base, it is called a frustum.  An \"elliptical cone\" is a cone with an elliptical base.  A \"generalized cone\" is the surface created by the set of lines passing through a vertex and every point on a boundary (also see visual hull).\n\n\n== Measurements and equations ==\n\n\n=== Volume ===\nThe volume \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   of any conic solid is one third of the product of the area of the base \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{B}}\n   and the height \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            3\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        h\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {1}{3}}A_{B}h.}\n  In modern mathematics, this formula can easily be computed using calculus \u2014 it is, up to scaling, the integral  Without using calculus, the formula can be proven by comparing the cone to a pyramid and applying Cavalieri's principle \u2013 specifically, comparing the cone to a (vertically scaled) right square pyramid, which forms one third of a cube. This formula cannot be proven without using such infinitesimal arguments \u2013 unlike the 2-dimensional formulae for polyhedral area, though similar to the area of the circle \u2013 and hence admitted less rigorous proofs before the advent of calculus, with the ancient Greeks using the method of exhaustion. This is essentially the content of Hilbert's third problem \u2013 more precisely, not all polyhedral pyramids are scissors congruent (can be cut apart into finite pieces and rearranged into the other), and thus volume cannot be computed purely by using a decomposition argument.\n\n\n=== Center of mass ===\nThe center of mass of a conic solid of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex, on the straight line joining the two.\n\n\n=== Right circular cone ===\n\n\n==== Volume ====\nFor a circular cone with radius r and height h, the base is a circle of area \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi r^{2}}\n   and so the formula for volume becomes\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            3\n          \n        \n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        h\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {1}{3}}\\pi r^{2}h.}\n  \n\n\n==== Slant height ====\nThe slant height of a right circular cone is the distance from any point on the circle of its base to the apex via a line segment along the surface of the cone.

same type (ellipse, parabola,...) one gets:\n\nAny plane section of an elliptic cone is a conic section.Obviously, any right circular cone contains circles. This is also true, but less obvious, in the general case (see circular section).\nThe intersection of an elliptic cone with a concentric sphere is a spherical conic.\n\n\n== Projective geometry ==\n\nIn projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity. Intuitively, if one keeps the base fixed and takes the limit as the apex goes to infinity, one obtains a cylinder, the angle of the side increasing as arctan, in the limit forming a right angle. This is useful in the definition of degenerate conics, which require considering the cylindrical conics.\nAccording to G. B. Halsted, a cone is generated similarly to a Steiner conic only with a projectivity and axial pencils (not in perspective) rather than the projective ranges used for the Steiner conic:\n\"If two copunctual non-costraight axial pencils are projective but not perspective, the meets of correlated planes form a 'conic surface of the second order', or 'cone'.\"\n\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\nThe definition of a cone may be extended to higher dimensions; see convex cone.  In this case, one says that a convex set C in the real vector space Rn is a cone (with apex at the origin) if for every vector x in C and every nonnegative real number a, the vector ax is in C.  In this context, the analogues of circular cones are not usually special; in fact one is often interested in  polyhedral cones.\nAn even more general concept is the topological cone, which is defined in arbitrary topological spaces.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBicone\nCone (linear algebra)\nCylinder (geometry)\nDemocritus\nGeneralized conic\nHyperboloid\nList of shapes\nPyrometric cone\nQuadric\nRotation of axes\nRuled surface\nTranslation of axes\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nProtter, Murray H.; Morrey, Charles B.

A polygon has exactly one internal angle per vertex.\nIf every internal angle of a simple polygon is less than \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0), then the polygon is called convex.\nIn contrast, an exterior angle (also called an external angle or turning angle) is an angle formed by one side of a simple polygon and a line extended from an adjacent side.:\u200app. 261-264\u200a\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe sum of the internal angle and the external angle on the same vertex is \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0).\nThe sum of all the internal angles of a simple polygon is \u03c0(n\u22122) radians or 180(n\u20132) degrees, where n is the number of sides. The formula can be proved by using mathematical induction: starting with a triangle, for which the angle sum is 180\u00b0, then replacing one side with two sides connected at another vertex, and so on.\nThe sum of the external angles of any simple convex or non-convex polygon, if only one of the two external angles is assumed at each vertex, is 2\u03c0 radians (360\u00b0).\nThe measure of the exterior angle at a vertex is unaffected by which side is extended: the two exterior angles that can be formed at a vertex by extending alternately one side or the other are vertical angles and thus are equal.\n\n\n== Extension to crossed polygons ==\nThe interior angle concept can be extended in a consistent way to crossed polygons such as star polygons by using the concept of directed angles. In general, the interior angle sum in degrees of any closed polygon, including crossed (self-intersecting) ones, is then given by 180(n\u20132k)\u00b0, where n is the number of vertices, and the strictly positive integer k is the number of total (360\u00b0) revolutions one undergoes by walking around the perimeter of the polygon. In other words, the sum of all the exterior angles is 2\u03c0k radians or 360k degrees. Example: for ordinary convex polygons and concave polygons, k = 1, since the exterior angle sum is 360\u00b0, and one undergoes only one full revolution by walking around the perimeter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternal angles of a triangle\nInterior angle sum of polygons: a general formula - Provides an interactive Java activity that extends the interior angle sum formula for simple closed polygons to include crossed (complex) polygons.", "Slope": "In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line. Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as \"y = mx + b\" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as \"y = mx + c\".Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the \"vertical change\" to the \"horizontal change\" between (any) two distinct points on a line.  Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient (\"rise over run\"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line.  A line that is decreasing has a negative \"rise\".  The line may be practical \u2013 as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan.\nThe steepness, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical. \n\nA line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. The slope is positive, i.e. \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m>0}\n  .\nA line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. The slope is negative, i.e. \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        <\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m<0}\n  .\nIf a line is horizontal the slope is zero. This is a constant function.\nIf a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below).The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say y1 and y2, or in other words, the rise is (y2 \u2212 y1) = \u0394y. For relatively short distances, where the Earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (x2 \u2212 x1) = \u0394x. Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line.\nIn mathematical language, the slope m of the line is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                y\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              \n                y\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              \n                x\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.}\n  The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering.

When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic expression, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve.\nThis generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors. Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe slope of a line in the plane containing the x and y axes is generally represented by the letter m, and is defined as the change in the y coordinate divided by the corresponding change in the x coordinate, between two distinct points on the line.

So these two lines are perpendicular.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nIn statistics, the gradient of the least-squares regression best-fitting line for a given sample of data may be written as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              r\n              \n                s\n                \n                  y\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              s\n              \n                x\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\frac {rs_{y}}{s_{x}}}}\n  ,This quantity m is called as the regression slope for the line \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        m\n        x\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=mx+c}\n  .

One is by the angle between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 (in degrees), and the other is by the slope in a percentage.

For example, steepness of 20% means 1:5 or an incline with angle 11.3\u00b0.\nRoads and railways have both longitudinal slopes and cross slopes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Calculus ==\n\nThe concept of a slope is central to differential calculus. For non-linear functions, the rate of change varies along the curve. The derivative of the function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point, and is thus equal to the rate of change of the function at that point.\nIf we let \u0394x and \u0394y be the distances (along the x and y axes, respectively) between two points on a curve, then the slope given by the above definition,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u0394\n              y\n            \n            \n              \u0394\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\frac {\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}}\n  ,is the slope of a secant line to the curve. For a line, the secant between any two points is the line itself, but this is not the case for any other type of curve.\nFor example, the slope of the secant intersecting y = x2 at (0,0) and (3,9) is 3. (The slope of the tangent at x = 3\u20442 is also 3 \u2212 a consequence of the mean value theorem.)\nBy moving the two points closer together so that \u0394y and \u0394x decrease, the secant line more closely approximates a tangent line to the curve, and as such the slope of the secant approaches that of the tangent. Using differential calculus, we can determine the limit, or the value that \u0394y/\u0394x approaches as \u0394y and \u0394x get closer to zero; it follows that this limit is the exact slope of the tangent. If y is dependent on x, then it is sufficient to take the limit where only \u0394x approaches zero. Therefore, the slope of the tangent is the limit of \u0394y/\u0394x as \u0394x approaches zero, or dy/dx. We call this limit the derivative.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          lim\n          \n            \u0394\n            x\n            \u2192\n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \u0394\n              y\n            \n            \n              \u0394\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}=\\lim _{\\Delta x\\to 0}{\\frac {\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}}\n  Its value at a point on the function gives us the slope of the tangent at that point. For example, let y = x2. A point on this function is (\u22122,4). The derivative of this function is dy\u2044dx = 2x. So the slope of the line tangent to y at (\u22122,4) is 2 \u22c5 (\u22122) = \u22124. The equation of this tangent line is: y \u2212 4 = (\u22124)(x \u2212 (\u22122)) or y = \u22124x \u2212 4.\n\n\n== Difference of slopes ==\nAn extension of the idea of angle follows from the difference of slopes.

Math Open Reference. 2009. Retrieved 30 October 2016. interactive", "Skew_lines": "In three-dimensional geometry, skew lines are two lines that do not intersect and are not parallel. A simple example of a pair of skew lines is the pair of lines through opposite edges of a regular tetrahedron.  Two lines that both lie in the same plane must either cross each other or be parallel, so skew lines can exist only in three or more dimensions. Two lines are skew if and only if they are not coplanar.\n\n\n== General position ==\nIf four points are chosen at random uniformly within a unit cube, they will almost surely define a pair of skew lines. After the first three points have been chosen, the fourth point will define a non-skew line if, and only if, it is coplanar with the first three points. However, the plane through the first three points forms a subset of measure zero of the cube, and the probability that the fourth point lies on this plane is zero. If it does not, the lines defined by the points will be skew.\nSimilarly, in three-dimensional space a very small perturbation of any two parallel or intersecting lines will almost certainly turn them into skew lines. Therefore, any four points in general position always form skew lines.\nIn this sense, skew lines are the \"usual\" case, and parallel or intersecting lines are special cases.\n\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n\n=== Testing for skewness ===\nIf each line in a pair of skew lines is defined by two points that it passes through, then these four points must not be coplanar, so they must be the vertices of a tetrahedron of nonzero volume. Conversely, any two pairs of points defining a tetrahedron of nonzero volume also define a pair of skew lines. Therefore, a test of whether two pairs of points define skew lines is to apply the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its four vertices. Denoting one point as the 1\u00d73 vector a whose three elements are the point's three coordinate values, and likewise denoting b, c, and d for the other points, we can check if the line through a and b is skew to the line through c and d by seeing if the tetrahedron volume formula gives a non-zero result:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n

parallel and this method cannot be used).\n\n\n== More than two lines ==\n\n\n=== Configurations ===\nA configuration of skew lines is a set of lines in which all pairs are skew. Two configurations are said to be isotopic if it is possible to continuously transform one configuration into the other, maintaining throughout the transformation the invariant that all pairs of lines remain skew. Any two configurations of two lines are easily seen to be isotopic, and configurations of the same number of lines in dimensions higher than three are always isotopic, but there exist multiple non-isotopic configurations of three or more lines in three dimensions. The number of nonisotopic configurations of n lines in R3, starting at n = 1, is\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 19, 74, ... (sequence A110887 in the OEIS).\n\n\n=== Ruled surfaces ===\n\nIf one rotates a line L around another line M skew but not perpendicular to it, the surface of revolution swept out by L is a hyperboloid of one sheet. For instance, the three hyperboloids visible in the illustration can be formed in this way by rotating a line L around the central white vertical line M. The copies of L within this surface form a regulus; the hyperboloid also contains a second family of lines that are also skew to M at the same distance as L from it but with the opposite angle that form the opposite regulus. The two reguli display the hyperboloid as a ruled surface.\nAn affine transformation of this ruled surface produces a surface which in general has an elliptical cross-section rather than the circular cross-section produced by rotating L around L'; such surfaces are also called hyperboloids of one sheet, and again are ruled by  two families of mutually skew lines.  A third type of ruled surface is the hyperbolic paraboloid. Like the hyperboloid of one sheet, the hyperbolic paraboloid has two families of skew lines; in each of the two families the lines are parallel to a common plane although not to each other.  Any three skew lines in R3 lie on exactly one ruled surface of one of these types.\n\n\n=== Gallucci's theorem ===\nIf three skew lines all meet three other skew lines, any transversal of the first set of three meets any transversal of the second set.\n\n\n== Skew flats in higher dimensions ==\nIn higher-dimensional space, a flat of dimension k is referred to as a k-flat. Thus, a line may also be called a 1-flat.\nGeneralizing the concept of skew lines to d-dimensional space, an i-flat and a j-flat may be skew if \ni + j < d. As with lines in 3-space, skew flats are those that are neither parallel nor intersect.\nIn affine d-space, two flats of any dimension may be parallel.\nHowever, in projective space, parallelism does not exist; two flats must either intersect or be skew.\nLet I be the set of points on an i-flat, and let J be the set of points on a j-flat.\nIn projective d-space, if i + j \u2265 d then the intersection of I and J must contain a (i+j\u2212d)-flat. (A 0-flat is a point.)\nIn either geometry, if I and J intersect at a k-flat, for k \u2265 0, then the points of I \u222a J determine a (i+j\u2212k)-flat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDistance between two parallel lines\nPetersen\u2013Morley theorem\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W., \"Skew Lines\", MathWorld", "Scaling_(geometry)": "In affine geometry, uniform scaling (or isotropic scaling) is a linear transformation that enlarges (increases) or shrinks (diminishes) objects by a scale factor that is the same in all directions. The result of uniform scaling is similar (in the geometric sense) to the original.  A scale factor of 1 is normally allowed, so that congruent shapes are also classed as similar.  Uniform scaling happens, for example, when enlarging or reducing a photograph, or when creating a scale model of a building, car, airplane, etc.\nMore general is scaling with a separate scale factor for each axis direction. Non-uniform scaling (anisotropic scaling) is obtained when at least one of the scaling factors is different from the others; a special case is directional scaling or stretching (in one direction). Non-uniform scaling changes the shape of the object; e.g. a square may change into a rectangle, or into a parallelogram if the sides of the square are not parallel to the scaling axes (the angles between lines parallel to the axes are preserved, but not all angles).  It occurs, for example, when a faraway billboard is viewed from an oblique angle, or when the shadow of a flat object falls on a surface that is not parallel to it.\nWhen the scale factor is larger than 1, (uniform or non-uniform) scaling is sometimes also called dilation or enlargement. When the scale factor is a positive number smaller than 1, scaling is sometimes also called contraction or reduction.\nIn the most general sense, a scaling includes the case in which the directions of scaling are not perpendicular. It also includes the case in which one or more scale factors are equal to zero (projection), and the case of one or more negative scale factors (a directional scaling by -1 is equivalent to a reflection).\nScaling is a linear transformation, and a special case of homothetic transformation (scaling about a point). In most cases, the homothetic transformations are non-linear transformations.\n\n\n== Uniform scaling ==\n\nA scale factor is usually a decimal which scales, or multiplies, some quantity. In the equation y = Cx, C is the scale factor for x. C is also the coefficient of x, and may be called the constant of proportionality of y to x.  For example, doubling distances corresponds to a scale factor of two for distance, while cutting a cake in half results in pieces with a scale factor for volume of one half.  The basic equation for it is image over preimage.\nIn the field of measurements, the scale factor of an instrument is sometimes referred to as sensitivity.  The ratio of any two corresponding lengths in two similar geometric figures is also called a scale.\n\n\n== Matrix representation ==\nA scaling can be represented by a scaling matrix.  To scale an object by a vector v = (vx, vy, vz), each point p = (px, py, pz) would need to be multiplied with this scaling matrix:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n

 Such a scaling changes the diameter of an object by a factor between the scale factors, the area by a factor between the smallest and the largest product of two scale factors, and the volume by the product of all three.\nThe scaling is uniform if and only if the scaling factors are equal (vx = vy = vz). If all except one of the scale factors are equal to 1, we have directional scaling.\nIn the case where vx = vy = vz = k, scaling increases the area of any surface by a factor of k2 and the volume of any solid object by a factor of k3.\n\n\n=== Scaling in arbitrary dimensions ===\nIn \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  -dimensional space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n  , uniform scaling by a factor \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n   is accomplished by scalar multiplication with \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  , that is, multiplying each coordinate of each point by \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  .

In non-uniform scaling only the vectors that belong to an eigenspace will retain their direction. A vector that is the sum of two or more non-zero vectors belonging to different eigenspaces will be tilted towards the eigenspace with largest eigenvalue.\n\n\n== Using homogeneous coordinates ==\nIn projective geometry, often used in computer graphics, points are represented using homogeneous coordinates.

External links ==\n\nUnderstanding 2D Scaling and Understanding 3D Scaling by Roger Germundsson, The Wolfram Demonstrations Project.\nScale Factor Calculator", "Space_(mathematics)": "In mathematics, a space is a set (sometimes called a universe) with some added structure.\nWhile modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as Euclidean spaces, linear spaces, topological spaces, Hilbert spaces, or probability spaces, it does not define the notion of \"space\" itself.\n\nA space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. \nThe nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. It is the relationships that define the nature of the space. More precisely, isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an isomorphism between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships. For example, the relationships between the points of a three-dimensional Euclidean space are uniquely determined by Euclid's axioms, and all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are considered identical.\nTopological notions such as continuity have natural definitions in every Euclidean space. \nHowever, topology does not distinguish straight lines from curved lines, and the relation between Euclidean and topological spaces is thus \"forgetful\". Relations of this kind are  treated in more detail in the Section \"Types of spaces\". \nIt is not always clear whether a given mathematical object should be considered as a geometric \"space\", or an  algebraic \"structure\". A general definition of \"structure\", proposed by Bourbaki, embraces all common types of spaces, provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies the transfer of properties between isomorphic structures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the golden age of geometry ===\n\nIn ancient Greek mathematics, \"space\" was a geometric abstraction of the three-dimensional reality observed in everyday life. About 300 BC, Euclid gave axioms for the properties of space. Euclid built all of mathematics on these geometric foundations, going so far as to define numbers by comparing the lengths of line segments to the length of a chosen reference segment.\nThe method of coordinates (analytic geometry) was adopted by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in 1637. At that time, geometric theorems were treated as absolute objective truths knowable through intuition and reason, similar to objects of natural science;:\u200a11\u200a and axioms were treated as obvious implications of definitions.:\u200a15\u200aTwo equivalence relations between geometric figures were used: congruence and similarity. Translations, rotations and reflections transform a figure into congruent figures; homotheties \u2014 into similar figures. For example, all circles are mutually similar, but ellipses are not similar to circles. A third equivalence relation, introduced by Gaspard Monge in 1795, occurs in projective geometry: not only ellipses, but also parabolas and hyperbolas, turn into circles under appropriate projective transformations; they all are projectively equivalent figures.\nThe relation between the two geometries, Euclidean and projective,:\u200a133\u200a shows that mathematical objects are not given to us with their structure.:\u200a21\u200a Rather, each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, precisely those that are put as axioms at the foundations of the theory.:\u200a20\u200aDistances and angles cannot appear in theorems of projective geometry, since these notions are neither mentioned in the axioms of projective geometry nor defined from the notions mentioned there. The question \"what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle\" is meaningful in Euclidean geometry but meaningless in projective geometry.\nA different situation appeared in the 19th century: in some geometries the sum of the three angles of a triangle is well-defined but different from the classical value (180 degrees). Non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, introduced by Nikolai Lobachevsky in 1829 and J\u00e1nos Bolyai in 1832 (and Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1816, unpublished):\u200a133\u200a stated that the sum depends on the triangle and is always less than 180 degrees. Eugenio Beltrami in 1868 and Felix Klein in 1871 obtained Euclidean \"models\" of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, and thereby completely justified this theory as a logical possibility.:\u200a24\u200aThis discovery forced the abandonment of the pretensions to the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry. It showed that axioms are not \"obvious\", nor \"implications of definitions\". Rather, they are hypotheses. To what extent do they correspond to an experimental reality? This important physical problem no longer has anything to do with mathematics. Even if a \"geometry\" does not correspond to an experimental reality, its theorems remain no less \"mathematical truths\".:\u200a15\u200aA Euclidean model of a non-Euclidean geometry is a choice of some objects existing in Euclidean space and some relations between these objects that satisfy all axioms (and therefore, all theorems) of the non-Euclidean geometry. These Euclidean objects and relations \"play\" the non-Euclidean geometry like contemporary actors playing an ancient performance. Actors can imitate a situation that never occurred in reality. Relations between the actors on the stage imitate relations between the characters in the play. Likewise, the chosen relations between the chosen objects of the Euclidean model imitate the non-Euclidean relations. It shows that relations between objects are essential in mathematics, while the nature of the objects is not.\n\n\n=== The golden age of geometry and afterwards ===\nThe word \"geometry\" (from Ancient Greek: geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") initially meant a practical way of processing lengths, regions and volumes in the space in which we live, but was then extended widely (as well as the notion of space in question here).\nAccording to Bourbaki,:\u200a131\u200a the period between 1795 (G\u00e9om\u00e9trie descriptive of Monge) and 1872 (the \"Erlangen programme\" of Klein) can be called \"the golden age of geometry\".  The original space investigated by Euclid is now called three-dimensional Euclidean space. Its axiomatization, started by Euclid 23 centuries ago, was reformed with Hilbert's axioms, Tarski's axioms and Birkhoff's axioms. These axiom systems describe the space via primitive notions (such as \"point\", \"between\", \"congruent\") constrained by a number of axioms.\nAnalytic geometry made great progress and succeeded in replacing theorems of classical geometry with computations via invariants of transformation groups.:\u200a134,\u200a5\u200a Since that time, new theorems of classical geometry have been of more interest to amateurs than to professional mathematicians.:\u200a136\u200a However, the heritage of classical geometry was not lost. According to Bourbaki,:\u200a138\u200a \"passed over in its role as an autonomous and living science, classical geometry is thus transfigured into a universal language of contemporary mathematics\".\nSimultaneously, numbers began to displace geometry as the foundation of mathematics.  For instance, in Richard Dedekind's 1872 essay Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen (Continuity and irrational numbers), he asserts that points on a line ought to have the properties of Dedekind cuts, and that therefore a line was the same thing as the set of real numbers.  Dedekind is careful to note that this is an assumption that is incapable of being proven.  In modern treatments, Dedekind's assertion is often taken to be the definition of a line, thereby reducing geometry to arithmetic.  Three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space whose associated vector space of differences of its elements is equipped with an inner product. A definition \"from scratch\", as in Euclid, is now not often used, since it does not reveal the relation of this space to other spaces. Also, a three-dimensional projective space is now defined as the space of all one-dimensional subspaces (that is, straight lines through the origin) of a four-dimensional vector space.  This shift in foundations requires a new set of axioms, and if these axioms are adopted, the classical axioms of geometry become theorems.\nA space now consists of selected mathematical objects (for instance, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space, or just elements of a set) treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. Therefore, spaces are just mathematical structures of convenience. One may expect that the structures called \"spaces\" are perceived more geometrically than other mathematical objects, but this is not always true.\nAccording to the famous inaugural lecture given by Bernhard Riemann in 1854, every mathematical object parametrized by n real numbers may be treated as a point of the n-dimensional space of all such objects.:\u200a140\u200a Contemporary mathematicians follow this idea routinely and find it extremely suggestive to use the terminology of classical geometry nearly everywhere.:\u200a138\u200aFunctions are important mathematical objects. Usually they form infinite-dimensional function spaces, as noted already by Riemann:\u200a141\u200a and elaborated in the 20th century by functional analysis.\n\n\n== Taxonomy of spaces ==\n\n\n=== Three taxonomic ranks ===\nWhile each type of space has its own definition, the general idea of \"space\" evades formalization. Some structures are called spaces, other are not, without a formal criterion. Moreover, there is no consensus on the general idea of \"structure\".\nAccording to Pudl\u00e1k, \"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have.\"\nWe will return to Bourbaki's structuralist approach in the last section \"Spaces and structures\", while  we now outline a possible classification of spaces (and structures) in the spirit of Bourbaki.\nWe classify spaces on three levels. Given that each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, the first question to ask is: which properties? This leads to the first (upper) classification level. On the second level, one takes into account answers to especially important questions (among the questions that make sense according to the first level). On the third level of classification, one takes into account answers to all possible questions.\nFor example, the upper-level classification distinguishes between Euclidean and projective spaces, since the distance between two points is defined in Euclidean spaces but undefined in projective spaces. \nAnother example. The question \"what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle\" makes sense in a Euclidean space but not in a projective space. In a non-Euclidean space the question makes sense but is answered differently, which is not an upper-level distinction.\nAlso, the distinction between a Euclidean plane and a Euclidean 3-dimensional space is not an upper-level distinction; the question \"what is the dimension\" makes sense in both cases.\nThe second-level classification distinguishes, for example, between Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces; between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces; between compact and non-compact spaces, etc.\nIn Bourbaki's terms, the second-level classification is the classification by \"species\". Unlike biological taxonomy, a space may belong to several species.\nThe third-level classification distinguishes, for example, between spaces of different dimension, but does not distinguish between a plane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and the set of all pairs of real numbers, also treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Likewise it does not distinguish between different Euclidean models of the same non-Euclidean space.\nMore formally, the third level classifies spaces up to isomorphism. An isomorphism between two spaces is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the first space and the points of the second space, that preserves all relations stipulated according to the first level. Mutually isomorphic spaces are thought of as copies of a single space. If one of them belongs to a given species then they all do.\nThe notion of isomorphism sheds light on the upper-level classification. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two spaces of the same upper-level class, one may ask whether it is an isomorphism or not. This question makes no sense for two spaces of different classes.\nAn isomorphism to itself is called an automorphism. Automorphisms of a Euclidean space are shifts, rotations, reflections and compositions of these. Euclidean space is homogeneous in the sense that every point can be transformed into every other point by some automorphism.\nEuclidean axioms leave no freedom; they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the space. More exactly: all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have \"the\" three-dimensional Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the corresponding theory is univalent. In contrast, topological spaces are generally non-isomorphic; their theory is multivalent. A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models of the same cardinality are mutually isomorphic. According to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.\n\n\n=== Relations between species of spaces ===\nTopological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean space is also a topological space. Every isomorphism between two Euclidean spaces is also an isomorphism between the corresponding topological spaces (called \"homeomorphism\"), but the converse is wrong: a homeomorphism may distort distances. In Bourbaki's terms, \"topological space\" is an underlying structure of the \"Euclidean space\" structure. Similar ideas occur in category theory: the category of Euclidean spaces is a concrete category over the category of topological spaces; the forgetful (or \"stripping\") functor maps the former category to the latter category.\nA three-dimensional Euclidean space is a special case of a Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the species of three-dimensional Euclidean space is richer than the species of Euclidean space. Likewise, the species of compact topological space is richer than the species of topological space.\n\nSuch relations between species of spaces may be expressed diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3. An arrow from A to B means that every A-space is also a B-space, or may be treated as a B-space, or provides a B-space, etc. Treating A and B as classes of spaces one may interpret the arrow as a transition from A to B. (In Bourbaki's terms, \"procedure of deduction\" of a B-space from a A-space. Not quite a function unless the classes A,B are sets; this nuance does not invalidate the following.) The two arrows on Fig. 3 are not invertible, but for different reasons. \nThe transition from \"Euclidean\" to \"topological\" is forgetful. Topology distinguishes continuous from discontinuous, but does not distinguish rectilinear from curvilinear. Intuition tells us that the Euclidean structure cannot be restored from the topology. A proof uses an automorphism of the topological space (that is, self-homeomorphism) that is not an automorphism of the Euclidean space (that is, not a composition of shifts, rotations and reflections). Such transformation turns the given Euclidean structure into a (isomorphic but) different Euclidean structure; both Euclidean structures correspond to a single topological structure.\nIn contrast, the transition from \"3-dim Euclidean\" to \"Euclidean\" is not forgetful; a Euclidean space need not be 3-dimensional, but if it happens to be 3-dimensional, it is full-fledged, no structure is lost. In other words, the latter transition is injective (one-to-one), while the former transition is not injective (many-to-one). We denote injective transitions by an arrow with a barbed tail, \"\u21a3\" rather than \"\u2192\".\nBoth transitions are not surjective, that is, not every B-space results from some A-space. First, a 3-dim Euclidean space is a special (not general) case of a Euclidean space. Second, a topology of a Euclidean space is a special case of topology (for instance, it must be non-compact, and connected, etc). We denote surjective transitions by a two-headed arrow, \"\u21a0\" rather than \"\u2192\". See for example Fig. 4; there, the arrow from \"real linear topological\" to \"real linear\" is two-headed, since every real linear space admits some (at least one) topology compatible with its linear structure.\nSuch topology is non-unique in general, but unique when the real linear space is finite-dimensional. For these spaces the transition is both injective and surjective, that is, bijective; see the arrow from \"finite-dim real linear topological\" to \"finite-dim real linear\" on Fig. 4. The inverse transition exists (and could be shown by a second, backward arrow). The two species of structures are thus equivalent. In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures. Equivalent structures may be treated as a single structure, as shown by a large box on Fig. 4.\nThe transitions denoted by the arrows obey isomorphisms. That is, two isomorphic A-spaces lead to two isomorphic B-spaces.\nThe diagram on Fig. 4 is commutative. That is, all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Other diagrams below are also commutative, except for dashed arrows on Fig. 9. The arrow from \"topological\" to \"measurable\" is dashed for the reason explained there: \"In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a \u03c3-algebra. The \u03c3-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice.\" A solid arrow denotes a prevalent, so-called \"canonical\" transition that suggests itself naturally and is widely used, often implicitly, by default. For example, speaking about a continuous function on a Euclidean space, one need not specify its topology explicitly. In fact, alternative topologies exist and are used sometimes, for example, the fine topology; but these are always specified explicitly, since they are much less notable that the prevalent topology. A dashed arrow indicates that several transitions are in use and no one is quite prevalent.\n\n\n== Types of spaces ==\n\n\n=== Linear and topological spaces ===\n\nTwo basic spaces are linear spaces (also called vector spaces) and topological spaces.\nLinear spaces are of algebraic nature; there are real linear spaces (over the field of real numbers),\ncomplex linear spaces (over the field of complex numbers), and more generally, linear spaces over any field. Every complex linear space is also a real linear space (the latter underlies the former), since each complex number can be specified by two real numbers. For example, the complex plane treated as a one-dimensional complex linear space may be downgraded to a two-dimensional real linear space. In contrast, the real line can be treated as a one-dimensional real linear space but not a complex linear space. See also field extensions. More generally, a vector space over a field also has the structure of a vector space over a subfield of that field.\nLinear operations, given in a linear space by definition, lead to such notions as straight lines (and planes, and other linear subspaces); parallel lines; ellipses (and ellipsoids). However, it is impossible to define \northogonal (perpendicular) lines, or to single out circles among ellipses, because in a linear space \nthere is no structure like a scalar product that could be used for measuring angles. The dimension of a linear space is defined as the maximal number of linearly independent vectors or, equivalently, as the minimal number of vectors that span the space; it may be finite or infinite. Two linear spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same dimension. A n-dimensional complex linear space is also a 2n-dimensional real linear space.\nTopological spaces are of analytic nature. Open sets, given in a topological space by definition, lead to such notions as continuous functions, paths, maps; convergent sequences, limits; interior, boundary, exterior. However, uniform continuity, bounded sets, Cauchy sequences, differentiable functions (paths, maps) remain undefined. Isomorphisms between topological spaces are traditionally called homeomorphisms; these are one-to-one correspondences continuous in both directions. The open interval (0,1) is homeomorphic to the whole real line (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) but not homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1], nor to a circle. The surface of a cube is homeomorphic to a sphere (the surface of a ball) but not homeomorphic to a torus. Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, which seems evident, but is not easy to prove. The dimension of a topological space is difficult to define; inductive dimension (based on the observation that the dimension of the boundary of a geometric figure is usually one less than the dimension of the figure itself) and Lebesgue covering dimension can be used. In the case of a n-dimensional Euclidean space, both topological dimensions are equal to n.\nEvery subset of a topological space is itself a topological space (in contrast, only linear subsets of a linear space are linear spaces). Arbitrary topological spaces, investigated by general topology (called also point-set topology) are too diverse for a complete classification up to homeomorphism. Compact topological spaces are an important class of topological spaces (\"species\" of this \"type\"). Every continuous function is bounded on such space. The closed interval [0,1] and the extended real line [\u2212\u221e,\u221e] are compact; the open interval (0,1) and the line (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) are not. Geometric topology investigates manifolds (another \"species\" of this \"type\"); these are topological spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces (and satisfying a few extra conditions). Low-dimensional manifolds are completely classified up to homeomorphism.\nBoth the linear and topological structures underlie the linear topological space (in other words, topological vector space) structure. A linear topological space is both a real or complex linear space and a topological space, such that the linear operations are continuous. So a linear space that is also topological is not in general a linear topological space. \nEvery finite-dimensional real or complex linear space is a linear topological space in the sense that it carries one and only one topology that makes it a linear topological space. The two structures, \"finite-dimensional real or complex linear space\" and \"finite-dimensional linear topological space\", are thus equivalent, that is, mutually underlying. Accordingly, every invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional linear topological space is a homeomorphism. The three notions of dimension (one algebraic and two topological) agree for finite-dimensional real linear spaces. In infinite-dimensional spaces, however, different topologies can conform to a given linear structure, and invertible linear transformations are generally not homeomorphisms.\n\n\n=== Affine and projective spaces ===\n\nIt is convenient to introduce affine and projective spaces by means of linear spaces, as follows. A n-dimensional linear subspace of a (n+1)-dimensional linear space, being itself a n-dimensional linear space, is not homogeneous; it contains a special point, the origin. Shifting it by a vector external to it, one obtains a n-dimensional affine subspace. It is homogeneous. An affine space need not be included into a linear space, but is isomorphic to an affine subspace of a linear space. All n-dimensional affine spaces over a given field are mutually isomorphic. In the words of John Baez, \"an affine space is a vector space that's forgotten its origin\". In particular, every linear space is also an affine space.\nGiven an n-dimensional affine subspace A in a (n+1)-dimensional linear space L, a straight line in A may be defined as the intersection of A with a two-dimensional linear subspace  of L that intersects A: in other words, with a plane through the origin that is not parallel to A. More generally, a k-dimensional affine subspace of A is the intersection of A with a (k+1)-dimensional linear subspace of L that intersects A.\nEvery point of the affine subspace A is the intersection of A with a one-dimensional linear subspace of L. However, some one-dimensional subspaces of L are parallel to A; in some sense, they intersect A at infinity. The set of all one-dimensional linear subspaces of a (n+1)-dimensional linear space is, by definition, a n-dimensional projective space. And the affine subspace A is embedded into the projective space as a proper subset. However, the projective space itself is homogeneous. A straight line in the projective space corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space. More generally, a k-dimensional projective subspace of the projective space corresponds to a (k+1)-dimensional linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space, and is isomorphic to the k-dimensional projective space.\nDefined this way, affine and projective spaces are of algebraic nature; they can be real, complex, and more generally, over any field.\nEvery real or complex affine or projective space is also a topological space. An affine space is a non-compact manifold; a projective space is a compact manifold. In a real projective space a straight line is homeomorphic to a circle, therefore compact, in contrast to a straight line in a linear of affine space.\n\n\n=== Metric and uniform spaces ===\n\nDistances between points are defined in a metric space. Isomorphisms between metric spaces are called isometries. Every metric space is also a topological space. A topological space is called metrizable, if it underlies a metric space. All manifolds are metrizable.\nIn a metric space, we can define \nbounded sets and Cauchy sequences. A metric space is called complete if all Cauchy sequences converge. Every incomplete space is isometrically embedded, as a dense subset, into a complete space (the completion). Every compact metric space is complete; the real line is non-compact but complete; the open interval (0,1) is incomplete. \nEvery Euclidean space is also a complete metric space. Moreover, all geometric notions immanent to a Euclidean space can be characterized in terms of its metric. For example, the straight segment connecting two given points A and C consists of all points B such that the distance between A and C is equal to the sum of two distances, between A and B and between B and C.\nThe Hausdorff dimension (related to the number of small balls that cover the given set) applies to metric spaces, and can be non-integer (especially for fractals). For a n-dimensional Euclidean space, the Hausdorff dimension is equal to n.\nUniform spaces do not introduce distances, but still allow one to use uniform continuity, Cauchy sequences (or filters or nets), completeness and completion. Every uniform space is also a topological space. Every linear topological space (metrizable or not) is also a uniform space, and is complete in finite dimension but generally incomplete in infinite dimension. More generally, every commutative topological group is also a uniform space. A non-commutative topological group, however, carries two uniform structures, one left-invariant, the other right-invariant.\n\n\n=== Normed, Banach, inner product, and Hilbert spaces ===\n\nVectors in a Euclidean space form a linear space, but each vector \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   has also a length, in other words, norm, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        x\n        \u2016\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lVert x\\rVert }\n  . A real or complex linear space endowed with a norm is a normed space. Every normed space is both a linear topological space and a metric space. A Banach space is a complete normed space. Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.\nThe set of all vectors of norm less than one is called the unit ball of a normed space. It is a convex, centrally symmetric set, generally not an ellipsoid; for example, it may be a polygon (in the plane) or, more generally, a polytope (in arbitrary finite dimension). The parallelogram law (called also parallelogram identity) \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        x\n        \u2212\n        y\n        \n          \u2016\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \u2016\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        \n          \u2016\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        2\n        \u2016\n        x\n        \n          \u2016\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        \u2016\n        y\n        \n          \u2016\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n         \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lVert x-y\\rVert ^{2}+\\lVert x+y\\rVert ^{2}=2\\lVert x\\rVert ^{2}+2\\lVert y\\rVert ^{2}\\ ,}\n  generally fails in normed spaces, but holds for vectors in Euclidean spaces, which follows from the fact that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2016\n        x\n        \n          \u2016\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lVert x\\rVert ^{2}=(x,x)}\n  .\nAn inner product space is a real or complex linear space, endowed with a bilinear or respectively sesquilinear form, satisfying some conditions and called an inner product. Every inner product space is also a normed space. A normed space underlies an inner product space if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law, or equivalently, if its unit ball is an ellipsoid. Angles between vectors are defined in inner product spaces. A Hilbert space is defined as a complete inner product space. (Some authors insist that it must be complex, others admit also real Hilbert spaces.) Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hilbert spaces are very important for quantum theory.All n-dimensional real inner product spaces are mutually isomorphic. One may say that the n-dimensional Euclidean space is the n-dimensional real inner product space that forgot its origin.\n\n\n=== Smooth and Riemannian manifolds ===\n\nSmooth manifolds are not called \"spaces\", but could be. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, and can be embedded into a finite-dimensional linear space. Smooth surfaces in a finite-dimensional linear space  are smooth manifolds: for example, the surface of an ellipsoid is a smooth manifold, a polytope is not. Real or complex finite-dimensional linear, affine and projective spaces are also smooth manifolds.\nAt each one of its points, a smooth path in a smooth manifold has a tangent vector that belongs to the manifold's tangent space at this point. Tangent spaces to an n-dimensional smooth manifold are n-dimensional linear spaces. The differential of a smooth function on a smooth manifold provides a linear functional on the tangent space at each point. \nA Riemannian manifold, or Riemann space, is a smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with inner products satisfying some conditions. Euclidean spaces are also Riemann spaces. Smooth surfaces in Euclidean spaces are Riemann spaces. A hyperbolic non-Euclidean space is also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has a length, and the length of the shortest curve between two points defines a distance, such that the Riemann space is a metric space. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.\nWaiving positivity of inner products on tangent spaces, one obtains pseudo-Riemann spaces, including the Lorentzian spaces that are very important for general relativity.\n\n\n=== Measurable, measure, and probability spaces ===\n\nWaiving distances and angles while retaining volumes (of geometric bodies) one reaches measure theory. Besides the volume, a measure generalizes the notions of area, length, mass (or charge) distribution, and also probability distribution, according to Andrey Kolmogorov's approach to probability theory.\nA \"geometric body\" of classical mathematics is much more regular than just a set of points. The boundary of the body is of zero volume. Thus, the volume of the body is the volume of its interior, and the interior can be exhausted by an infinite sequence of cubes. In contrast, the boundary of an arbitrary set of points can be of non-zero volume (an example: the set of all rational points inside a given cube). Measure theory succeeded in extending the notion of volume to a vast class of sets, the so-called measurable sets. Indeed, non-measurable sets almost never occur in applications.\nMeasurable sets, given in a measurable space by definition, lead to measurable functions and maps. In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a \u03c3-algebra. The \u03c3-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice. (Baire sets, universally measurable sets, etc, are also used sometimes.) \nThe topology is not uniquely determined by the Borel \u03c3-algebra; for example, the norm topology and the weak topology on a separable Hilbert space lead to the same Borel \u03c3-algebra.\nNot every \u03c3-algebra is the Borel \u03c3-algebra of some topology.\nActually, a \u03c3-algebra can be generated by a given collection of sets (or functions) irrespective of any topology.  Every subset of a measurable space is itself a measurable space.\nStandard measurable spaces (also called standard Borel spaces) are especially useful due to some similarity to compact spaces (see EoM). Every bijective measurable mapping between standard measurable spaces is an isomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable. And a mapping between such spaces is measurable if and only if its graph is measurable in the product space. Similarly, every bijective continuous mapping between compact metric spaces is a homeomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also continuous. And a mapping between such spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed in the product space.\nEvery Borel set in a Euclidean space (and more generally, in a complete separable metric space), endowed with the Borel \u03c3-algebra, is a standard measurable space. All uncountable standard measurable spaces are mutually isomorphic.\nA measure space is a measurable space endowed with a measure. A Euclidean space with the Lebesgue measure is a measure space. Integration theory defines integrability and integrals of measurable functions on a measure space.\nSets of measure 0, called null sets, are negligible. Accordingly, a \"mod 0 isomorphism\" is defined as isomorphism between subsets of full measure (that is, with negligible complement).\nA probability space is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to 1. The product of any family (finite or not) of probability spaces is a probability space. In contrast, for measure spaces in general, only the product of finitely many spaces is defined. Accordingly, there are many infinite-dimensional probability measures (especially, Gaussian measures), but no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures.\nStandard probability spaces are especially useful. On a standard probability space a conditional expectation may be treated as the integral over the conditional measure (regular conditional probabilities, see also disintegration of measure). Given two standard probability spaces, every homomorphism of their measure algebras is induced by some measure preserving map. Every probability measure on a standard measurable space leads to a standard probability space. The product of a sequence (finite or not) of standard probability spaces is a standard probability space. All non-atomic standard probability spaces are mutually isomorphic mod 0; one of them is the interval (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure.\nThese spaces are less geometric. In particular, the idea of dimension, applicable (in one form or another) to all other spaces, does not apply to measurable, measure and probability spaces.\n\n\n=== Non-commutative geometry ===\nThe theoretical study of calculus, known as mathematical analysis, led in the early 20th century to the consideration of linear spaces of real-valued or complex-valued functions.  The earliest examples of these were function spaces, each one adapted to its own class of problems.  These examples shared many common features, and these features were soon abstracted into Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and more general topological vector spaces.  These were a powerful toolkit for the solution of a wide range of mathematical problems.\nThe most detailed information was carried by a class of spaces called Banach algebras.  These are Banach spaces together with a continuous multiplication operation.  An important early example was the Banach algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions on a measure space X.  This set of functions is a Banach space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication.  With the operation of pointwise multiplication, it becomes a special type of Banach space, one now called a commutative von Neumann algebra.  Pointwise multiplication determines a representation of this algebra on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on X.  An early observation of John von Neumann was that this correspondence also worked in reverse: Given some mild technical hypotheses, a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a representation on a Hilbert space determines a measure space, and these two constructions (of a von Neumann algebra plus a representation and of a measure space) are mutually inverse.\nVon Neumann then proposed that non-commutative von Neumann algebras should have geometric meaning, just as commutative von Neumann algebras do.  Together with Francis Murray, he produced a classification of von Neumann algebras.  The direct integral construction shows how to break any von Neumann algebra into a collection of simpler algebras called factors.  Von Neumann and Murray classified factors into three types.  Type I was nearly identical to the commutative case.  Types II and III exhibited new phenomena.  A type II von Neumann algebra determined a geometry with the peculiar feature that the dimension could be any non-negative real number, not just an integer.  Type III algebras were those that were neither types I nor II, and after several decades of effort, these were proven to be closely related to type II factors.\nA slightly different approach to the geometry of function spaces developed at the same time as von Neumann and Murray's work on the classification of factors.  This approach is the theory of C*-algebras.  Here, the motivating example is the C*-algebra \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}(X)}\n  , where X is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space.  By definition, this is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on X that vanish at infinity (which loosely means that the farther you go from a chosen point, the closer the function gets to zero) with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication.  The Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem implied that there is a correspondence between commutative C*-algebras and geometric objects: Every commutative C*-algebra is of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}(X)}\n   for some locally compact Hausdorff space X.  Consequently it is possible to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces purely in terms of commutative C*-algebras.  Non-commutative geometry takes this as inspiration for the study of non-commutative C*-algebras: If there were such a thing as a \"non-commutative space X,\" then its \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}(X)}\n   would be a non-commutative C*-algebra; if in addition the Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem applied to these non-existent objects, then spaces (commutative or not) would be the same as C*-algebras; so, for lack of a direct approach to the definition of a non-commutative space, a non-commutative space is defined to be a non-commutative C*-algebra.  Many standard geometric tools can be restated in terms of C*-algebras, and this gives geometrically-inspired techniques for studying non-commutative C*-algebras.\nBoth of these examples are now cases of a field called non-commutative geometry.  The specific examples of von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras are known as non-commutative measure theory and non-commutative topology, respectively.  Non-commutative geometry is not merely a pursuit of generality for its own sake and is not just a curiosity.  Non-commutative spaces arise naturally, even inevitably, from some constructions.  For example, consider the non-periodic Penrose tilings of the plane by kites and darts.  It is a theorem that, in such a tiling, every finite patch of kites and darts appears infinitely often.  As a consequence, there is no way to distinguish two Penrose tilings by looking at a finite portion.  This makes it impossible to assign the set of all tilings a topology in the traditional sense.  Despite this, the Penrose tilings determine a non-commutative C*-algebra, and consequently they can be studied by the techniques of non-commutative geometry.  Another example, and one of great interest within differential geometry, comes from foliations of manifolds.  These are ways of splitting the manifold up into smaller-dimensional submanifolds called leaves, each of which is locally parallel to others nearby.  The set of all leaves can be made into a topological space.  However, the example of an irrational rotation shows that this topological space can be inaccessible to the techniques of classical measure theory.  However, there is a non-commutative von Neumann algebra associated to the leaf space of a foliation, and once again, this gives an otherwise unintelligible space a good geometric structure.\n\n\n=== Schemes ===\n\nAlgebraic geometry studies the geometric properties of polynomial equations.  Polynomials are a type of function defined from the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.  Because of this, they are closely tied to algebra. Algebraic geometry offers a way to apply geometric techniques to questions of pure algebra, and vice versa.\nPrior to the 1940s, algebraic geometry worked exclusively over the complex numbers, and the most fundamental variety was projective space.  The geometry of projective space is closely related to the theory of perspective, and its algebra is described by homogeneous polynomials.  All other varieties were defined as subsets of projective space.  Projective varieties were subsets defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials.  At each point of the projective variety, all the polynomials in the set were required to equal zero.  The complement of the zero set of a linear polynomial is an affine space, and an affine variety was the intersection of a projective variety with an affine space.\nAndr\u00e9 Weil saw that geometric reasoning could sometimes be applied in number-theoretic situations where the spaces in question might be discrete or even finite.  In pursuit of this idea, Weil rewrote the foundations of algebraic geometry, both freeing algebraic geometry from its reliance on complex numbers and introducing abstract algebraic varieties which were not embedded in projective space.  These are now simply called varieties.\nThe type of space that underlies most modern algebraic geometry is even more general than Weil's abstract algebraic varieties.  It was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck and is called a scheme.  One of the motivations for scheme theory is that polynomials are unusually structured among functions, and algebraic varieties are consequently rigid.  This presents problems when attempting to study degenerate situations.  For example, almost any pair of points on a circle determines a unique line called the secant line, and as the two points move around the circle, the secant line varies continuously.  However, when the two points collide, the secant line degenerates to a tangent line.  The tangent line is unique, but the geometry of this configuration\u2014a single point on a circle\u2014is not expressive enough to determine a unique line.  Studying situations like this requires a theory capable of assigning extra data to degenerate situations.\nOne of the building blocks of a scheme is a topological space.  Topological spaces have continuous functions, but continuous functions are too general to reflect the underlying algebraic structure of interest. The other ingredient in a scheme, therefore, is a sheaf on the topological space, called the \"structure sheaf\".  On each open subset of the topological space, the sheaf specifies a collection of functions, called \"regular functions\".  The topological space and the structure sheaf together are required to satisfy conditions that mean the functions come from algebraic operations.\nLike manifolds, schemes are defined as spaces that are locally modeled on a familiar space.  In the case of manifolds, the familiar space is Euclidean space.  For a scheme, the local models are called affine schemes.  Affine schemes provide a direct link between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  The fundamental objects of study in commutative algebra are commutative rings.  If \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n   is a commutative ring, then there is a corresponding affine scheme \n  \n    \n      \n        Spec\n        \u2061\n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} R}\n   which translates the algebraic structure of \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n   into geometry.  Conversely, every affine scheme determines a commutative ring, namely, the ring of global sections of its structure sheaf.  These two operations are mutually inverse, so affine schemes provide a new language with which to study questions in commutative algebra.  By definition, every point in a scheme has an open neighborhood which is an affine scheme.\nThere are many schemes that are not affine.  In particular,  projective spaces satisfy a condition called properness which is analogous to compactness.  Affine schemes cannot be proper (except in trivial situations like when the scheme has only a single point), and hence no projective space is an affine scheme (except for zero-dimensional projective spaces).  Projective schemes, meaning those that arise as closed subschemes of a projective space, are the single most important family of schemes.Several generalizations of schemes have been introduced.  Michael Artin defined an algebraic space as the quotient of a scheme by the equivalence relations that define \u00e9tale morphisms.  Algebraic spaces retain many of the useful properties of schemes while simultaneously being more flexible.  For instance, the Keel\u2013Mori theorem can be used to show that many moduli spaces are algebraic spaces.\nMore general than an algebraic space is a Deligne\u2013Mumford stack.  DM stacks are similar to schemes, but they permit singularities that cannot be described solely in terms of polynomials.  They play the same role for schemes that orbifolds do for manifolds.  For example, the quotient of the affine plane by a finite group of rotations around the origin yields a Deligne\u2013Mumford stack that is not a scheme or an algebraic space.  Away from the origin, the quotient by the group action identifies finite sets of equally spaced points on a circle.  But at the origin, the circle consists of only a single point, the origin itself, and the group action fixes this point.  In the quotient DM stack, however, this point comes with the extra data of being a quotient.  This kind of refined structure is useful in the theory of moduli spaces, and in fact, it was originally introduced to describe moduli of algebraic curves.\nA further generalization are the algebraic stacks, also called Artin stacks.  DM stacks are limited to quotients by finite group actions.  While this suffices for many problems in moduli theory, it is too restrictive for others, and Artin stacks permit more general quotients.\n\n\n=== Topoi ===\n\nIn Grothendieck's work on the Weil conjectures, he introduced a new type of topology now called a Grothendieck topology.  A topological space (in the ordinary sense) axiomatizes the notion of \"nearness,\" making two points be nearby if and only if they lie in many of the same open sets.  By contrast, a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the notion of \"covering\".  A covering of a space is a collection of subspaces that jointly contain all the information of the ambient space.  Since sheaves are defined in terms of coverings, a Grothendieck topology can also be seen as an axiomatization of the theory of sheaves.\nGrothendieck's work on his topologies led him to the theory of topoi.  In his memoir R\u00e9coltes et Semailles, he called them his \"most vast conception\". A sheaf (either on a topological space or with respect to a Grothendieck topology) is used to express local data.  The category of all sheaves carries all possible ways of expressing local data.  Since topological spaces are constructed from points, which are themselves a kind of local data, the category of sheaves can therefore be used as a replacement for the original space.  Grothendieck consequently defined a topos to be a category of sheaves and studied topoi as objects of interest in their own right.  These are now called Grothendieck topoi.\nEvery topological space determines a topos, and vice versa.  There are topological spaces where taking the associated topos loses information, but these are generally considered pathological.  (A necessary and sufficient condition is that the topological space be a sober space.)  Conversely, there are topoi whose associated topological spaces do not capture the original topos.  But, far from being pathological, these topoi can be of great mathematical interest.  For instance, Grothendieck's theory of \u00e9tale cohomology (which eventually led to the proof of the Weil conjectures) can be phrased as cohomology in the \u00e9tale topos of a scheme, and this topos does not come from a topological space.\nTopological spaces in fact lead to very special topoi called locales.  The set of open subsets of a topological space determines a lattice.  The axioms for a topological space cause these lattices to be complete Heyting algebras.  The theory of locales takes this as its starting point.  A locale is defined to be a complete Heyting algebra, and the elementary properties of topological spaces are re-expressed and reproved in these terms.  The concept of a locale turns out to be more general than a topological space, in that every sober topological space determines a unique locale, but many interesting locales do not come from topological spaces.  Because locales need not have points, the study of locales is somewhat jokingly called pointless topology.\nTopoi also display deep connections to mathematical logic.  Every Grothendieck topos has a special sheaf called a subobject classifier.  This subobject classifier functions like the set of all possible truth values.  In the topos of sets, the subobject classifier is the set \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{0,1\\}}\n  , corresponding to \"False\" and \"True\".  But in other topoi, the subobject classifier can be much more complicated.  Lawvere and Tierney recognized that axiomatizing the subobject classifier yielded a more general kind of topos, now known as an elementary topos, and that elementary topoi were models of intuitionistic logic.  In addition to providing a powerful way to apply tools from logic to geometry, this made possible the use of geometric methods in logic.\n\n\n== Spaces and structure ==\nAccording to Kevin Carlson,\n\nNeither of these words [\"space\" and \"structure\"] have a single mathematical definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same situations, but you often think of a \"space\" as more geometric and a \"structure\" as more algebraic. [...] So you could think of \"structures\" as places we do algebra, and \"spaces\" as places we do geometry. Then a lot of great mathematics has come from passing from structures to spaces and vice versa, as when we look at the fundamental group of a topological space or the spectrum of a ring. But in the end, the distinction is neither hard nor fast and only goes so far: many things are obviously both structures and spaces, some things are not obviously either, and some people might well disagree with everything I've said here.Nevertheless, a general definition of \"structure\" was proposed by Bourbaki; it embraces all types of spaces mentioned above, (nearly?) all types of mathematical structures used till now, and more. It provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies transfer of properties between isomorphic structures. However, it was never used actively in mathematical practice (not even in the mathematical treatises written by Bourbaki himself). Here are the last phrases from a review by Robert Reed of a book by Leo Corry:\n\nCorry does not seem to feel that any formal definition of structure could do justice to the use of the concept in actual mathematical practice [...] Corry's view could be summarized as the belief that 'structure' refers essentially to a way of doing mathematics, and is therefore a concept probably just as far from being precisely definable as the cultural artifact of mathematics itself.For more information on mathematical structures see Wikipedia: mathematical structure, equivalent definitions of mathematical structures, and transport of structure.\nThe distinction between geometric \"spaces\" and algebraic \"structures\" is sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, groups are algebraic, while Euclidean spaces are geometric. Modules over rings are as algebraic as groups. In particular, when the ring appears to be a field, the module appears to be a linear space; is it algebraic or geometric? In particular, when it is finite-dimensional, over real numbers, and endowed with inner product, it becomes Euclidean space; now geometric. The (algebraic?) field of real numbers is the same as the (geometric?) real line. Its algebraic closure, the (algebraic?) field of complex numbers, is the same as the (geometric?) complex plane. It is first of all \"a place we do analysis\" (rather than algebra or geometry).\nEvery space treated in Section \"Types of spaces\" above, except for \"Non-commutative geometry\", \"Schemes\" and \"Topoi\" subsections, is a set (the \"principal base set\" of the structure, according to Bourbaki) endowed with some additional structure; elements of the base set are usually called \"points\" of this space. In contrast, elements of (the base set of) an algebraic structure usually are not called \"points\".\nHowever, sometimes one uses more than one principal base set. For example, two-dimensional projective geometry may be formalized via two base sets, the set of points and the set of lines. Moreover, a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the roles played by points and lines. A less geometric example: a graph may be formalized via two base sets, the set of vertices (called also nodes or points) and the set of edges (called also arcs or lines). Generally, finitely many principal base sets and finitely many auxiliary base sets are stipulated by Bourbaki.\nMany mathematical structures of geometric flavor treated in the \"Non-commutative geometry\", \"Schemes\" and \"Topoi\" subsections above do not stipulate a base set of points. For example, \"pointless topology\" (in other words, point-free topology, or locale theory) starts with a single base set whose elements imitate open sets in a topological space (but are not sets of points); see also mereotopology and point-free geometry.\n\n\n== List of mathematical spaces ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMathematical structure\nTransport of structure\nSet (mathematics)\nDimension\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n This article was submitted to WikiJournal of Science for external academic peer review in 2017 (reviewer reports).
